                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And hath put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,</span>

                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</span>

                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Not of works, lest any man should boast.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</span>

                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</span>

                <span id="5v28">(<a href="#5v28">28)</a> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span>
