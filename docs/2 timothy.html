                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> To Timothy, [my] dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth among us.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found [me].</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span>
                
            </p>

            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And if a man also strive for masteries, [yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> [It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him], we shall also live with [him]:</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> If we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]: if we deny [him], he also will deny us:</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Of these things put [them] in remembrance, charging [them] before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] to the subverting of the hearers.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> But shun profane [and] vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all [men], apt to teach, patient,</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> And [that] they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with cringes, led away with divers lusts,</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as their's also was.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them] all the Lord delivered me.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</span>
