                <span id="21v21">(<a href="#21v21">21)</a> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="21v22">(<a href="#21v22">22)</a> Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of the well: [but] we will go along by the king's [high] way, until we be past thy borders.</span>
                
                <span id="21v23">(<a href="#21v23">23)</a> And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="21v24">(<a href="#21v24">24)</a> And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was] strong.</span>
                
                <span id="21v25">(<a href="#21v25">25)</a> And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</span>
                
                <span id="21v26">(<a href="#21v26">26)</a> For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</span>
                
                <span id="21v27">(<a href="#21v27">27)</a> Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</span>

                <span id="21v29">(<a href="#21v29">29)</a> Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</span>
                
                <span id="21v30">(<a href="#21v30">30)</a> We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which [reacheth] unto Medeba.</span>

                <span id="21v31">(<a href="#21v31">31)</a> Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</span>
                
                <span id="21v32">(<a href="#21v32">32)</a> And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that [were] there.</span>

                <span id="21v33">(<a href="#21v33">33)</a> And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span>
                
                <span id="21v34">(<a href="#21v34">34)</a> And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span>
                
                <span id="21v35">(<a href="#21v35">35)</a> So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</span>

                <span id="22v23">(<a href="#22v23">23)</a> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</span>
                
                <span id="22v24">(<a href="#22v24">24)</a> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.</span>
                
                <span id="22v25">(<a href="#22v25">25)</a> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</span>
                
                <span id="22v26">(<a href="#22v26">26)</a> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span>
                
                <span id="22v27">(<a href="#22v27">27)</a> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</span>
                
                <span id="22v28">(<a href="#22v28">28)</a> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</span>
                
                <span id="22v29">(<a href="#22v29">29)</a> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</span>
                
                <span id="22v30">(<a href="#22v30">30)</a> And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</span>
                
                <span id="22v31">(<a href="#22v31">31)</a> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</span>
                
                <span id="22v32">(<a href="#22v32">32)</a> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:</span>
                
                <span id="22v33">(<a href="#22v33">33)</a> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</span>
                
                <span id="22v34">(<a href="#22v34">34)</a> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have cringed; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</span>
                
                <span id="22v35">(<a href="#22v35">35)</a> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span>

                <span id="22v37">(<a href="#22v37">37)</a> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</span>
                
                <span id="22v38">(<a href="#22v38">38)</a> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</span>
                
                <span id="22v39">(<a href="#22v39">39)</a> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.</span>
