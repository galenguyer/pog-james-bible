                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span>
                
                <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</span>
