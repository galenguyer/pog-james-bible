        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out unto thee [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence [are] before me: and there are [that] raise up strife and contention.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye will not believe, though it be told [you].</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] not their's.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle [that] hasteth to eat.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, [imputing] this his power unto his god.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> [Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is] more righteous than he?</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, [that have] no ruler over them?</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat plenteous.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Behold, his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and [for] the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast cringed [against] thy soul.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Behold, [is it] not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing [shall be] on thy glory.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all in the midst of it.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> But the LORD [is] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span>

            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> O LORD, I have heard thy speech, [and] was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And [his] brightness was as the light; he had horns [coming] out of his hand: and there [was] the hiding of his power.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: [and] the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thy chariots of salvation?</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Thy bow was made quite naked, [according] to the oaths of the tribes, [even thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> The mountains saw thee, [and] they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, [and] lifted up his hands on high.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, [even] for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly.</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, [through] the heap of great waters.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span>

            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit [be] in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls:</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> The LORD God [is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</span>
