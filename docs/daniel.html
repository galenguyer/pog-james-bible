            <h2>Daniel</h2>
            
            <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall ye make [me] endanger my head to the king.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And Daniel continued [even] unto the first year of king Cyrus.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, [there is but] one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore [there is] no king, lord, nor ruler, [that] asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And [it is] a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise [men] of Babylon.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise [men] of Babylon:</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why [is] the decree [so] hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of Babylon.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known unto us the king's matter.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span>
                
                <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise [men], the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</span>
                
                <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</span>
                
                <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</span>
                
                <span id="2v30">(<a href="#2v30">30)</a> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v31">(<a href="#2v31">31)</a> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness [was] excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof [was] terrible.</span>
                
                <span id="2v32">(<a href="#2v32">32)</a> This image's head [was] of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</span>
                
                <span id="2v33">(<a href="#2v33">33)</a> His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</span>
                
                <span id="2v34">(<a href="#2v34">34)</a> Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</span>
                
                <span id="2v35">(<a href="#2v35">35)</a> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v36">(<a href="#2v36">36)</a> This [is] the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</span>
                
                <span id="2v37">(<a href="#2v37">37)</a> Thou, O king, [art] a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</span>
                
                <span id="2v38">(<a href="#2v38">38)</a> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] this head of gold.</span>
                
                <span id="2v39">(<a href="#2v39">39)</a> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v40">(<a href="#2v40">40)</a> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things]: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</span>
                
                <span id="2v41">(<a href="#2v41">41)</a> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</span>
                
                <span id="2v42">(<a href="#2v42">42)</a> And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span>
                
                <span id="2v43">(<a href="#2v43">43)</a> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</span>

                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter.</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thine hand, O king.</span>

                <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> And he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace.</span>
                
                <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span>
                
                <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</span>
                
                <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span>
                
                <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, [and] spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

                <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</span>

                <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, [and] spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come [hither]. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</span>
                
                <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</span>
                
                <span id="3v28">(<a href="#3v28">28)</a> [Then] Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed [be] the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v29">(<a href="#3v29">29)</a> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</span>
                
                <span id="3v30">(<a href="#3v30">30)</a> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</span>

                <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, [saying],</span>

                <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> Thus [were] the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof [was] great.</span>
                
                <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</span>

                <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</span>

                <span id="4v20">(<a href="#4v20">20)</a> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</span>

                <span id="4v22">(<a href="#4v22">22)</a> It [is] thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</span>
                
                <span id="4v23">(<a href="#4v23">23)</a> And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</span>
                
                <span id="4v24">(<a href="#4v24">24)</a> This [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</span>
                
                <span id="4v25">(<a href="#4v25">25)</a> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span>
                
                <span id="4v26">(<a href="#4v26">26)</a> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</span>
                
                <span id="4v27">(<a href="#4v27">27)</a> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy cringes by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</span>

                <span id="4v30">(<a href="#4v30">30)</a> The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</span>
                
                <span id="4v31">(<a href="#4v31">31)</a> While the word [was] in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</span>
                
                <span id="4v32">(<a href="#4v32">32)</a> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span>
                
                <span id="4v33">(<a href="#4v33">33)</a> The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</span>

                <span id="6v15">(<a href="#6v15">15)</a> Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians [is], That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</span>
                
                <span id="6v16">(<a href="#6v16">16)</a> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions. [Now] the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</span>
                
                <span id="6v17">(<a href="#6v17">17)</a> And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</span>

                <span id="6v21">(<a href="#6v21">21)</a> Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="6v22">(<a href="#6v22">22)</a> My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</span>
                
                <span id="6v23">(<a href="#6v23">23)</a> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</span>

                <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span>
                
                <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld [even] till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</span>
                
                <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</span>
                
                <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, [one] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</span>
                
                <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.</span>

                <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span>
                
                <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span>
                
                <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise out of the earth.</span>

                <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</span>
                
                <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> And of the ten horns that [were] in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look [was] more stout than his fellows.</span>
                
                <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span>

                <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span>
                
                <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</span>
                
                <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> And he shall speak [great] words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</span>
                
                <span id="7v26">(<a href="#7v26">26)</a> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy [it] unto the end.</span>

                <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, [even unto] me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</span>
                
                <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I [was] at Shushan [in] the palace, which [is] in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</span>
                
                <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span>
                
                <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</span>
                
                <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes.</span>
                
                <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</span>
                
                <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span>
                
                <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</span>
                
                <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant [land].</span>
                
                <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> And it waxed great, [even] to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</span>
                
                <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> Yea, he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span>
                
                <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> And an host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain [saint] which spake, How long [shall be] the vision [concerning] the daily [sacrifice], and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</span>
                
                <span id="8v14">(<a href="#8v14">14)</a> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="8v15">(<a href="#8v15">15)</a> And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</span>
                
                <span id="8v16">(<a href="#8v16">16)</a> And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.</span>
                
                <span id="8v17">(<a href="#8v17">17)</a> So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] the vision.</span>
                
                <span id="8v18">(<a href="#8v18">18)</a> Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</span>
                
                <span id="8v19">(<a href="#8v19">19)</a> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shall be].</span>
                
                <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> The ram which thou sawest having [two] horns [are] the kings of Media and Persia.</span>
                
                <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> And the rough goat [is] the king of Grecia: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the first king.</span>
                
                <span id="8v22">(<a href="#8v22">22)</a> Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</span>
                
                <span id="8v23">(<a href="#8v23">23)</a> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</span>
                
                <span id="8v24">(<a href="#8v24">24)</a> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</span>
                
                <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</span>
                
                <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days.</span>
                
                <span id="8v27">(<a href="#8v27">27)</a> And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].</span>

                <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing [was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</span>
                
                <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</span>
                
                <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span>
                
                <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel;</span>
                
                <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</span>
                
                <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</span>
                
                <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</span>
                
                <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</span>
                
                <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands.</span>
                
                <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</span>
                
                <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</span>
                
                <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span>
                
                <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision [is] for [many] days.</span>
                
                <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span>
                
                <span id="10v16">(<a href="#10v16">16)</a> And, behold, [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</span>
                
                <span id="10v17">(<a href="#10v17">17)</a> For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</span>
                
                <span id="10v18">(<a href="#10v18">18)</a> Then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</span>
                
                <span id="10v19">(<a href="#10v19">19)</a> And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace [be] unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span>
                
                <span id="10v20">(<a href="#10v20">20)</a> Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</span>
                
                <span id="10v21">(<a href="#10v21">21)</a> But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span>

                <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, [even] I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</span>
                
                <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</span>
                
                <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</span>
                
                <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion [shall be] a great dominion.</span>
                
                <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in [these] times.</span>
                
                <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> But out of a branch of her roots shall [one] stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</span>
                
                <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, [and] with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue [more] years than the king of the north.</span>
                
                <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> So the king of the south shall come into [his] kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</span>
                
                <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and [one] shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, [even] to his fortress.</span>
                
                <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, [even] with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</span>
                
                <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> [And] when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down [many] ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened [by it].</span>
                
                <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</span>
                
                <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</span>
                
                <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither [shall there be any] strength to withstand.</span>
                
                <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</span>
                
                <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand [on his side], neither be for him.</span>
                
                <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause [it] to turn upon him.</span>
                
                <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</span>
                
                <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [in] the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</span>
                
                <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</span>
                
                <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</span>
                
                <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> And after the league [made] with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</span>
                
                <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do [that] which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: [yea], and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</span>
                
                <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</span>
                
                <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</span>
                
                <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> And both these kings' hearts [shall be] to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end [shall be] at the time appointed.</span>
                
                <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [exploits], and return to his own land.</span>
                
                <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</span>

                <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</span>
                
                <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily [sacrifice], and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</span>
                
                <span id="11v32">(<a href="#11v32">32)</a> And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits].</span>
                
                <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, [many] days.</span>

                <span id="11v36">(<a href="#11v36">36)</a> And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</span>
                
                <span id="11v37">(<a href="#11v37">37)</a> Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</span>
                
                <span id="11v38">(<a href="#11v38">38)</a> But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</span>
                
                <span id="11v39">(<a href="#11v39">39)</a> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge [and] increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</span>
                
                <span id="11v40">(<a href="#11v40">40)</a> And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</span>
                
                <span id="11v41">(<a href="#11v41">41)</a> He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, [even] Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</span>
                
                <span id="11v42">(<a href="#11v42">42)</a> He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</span>

                <span id="11v45">(<a href="#11v45">45)</a> And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</span>
