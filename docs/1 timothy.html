                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope;</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for cringers, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save cringers; of whom I am chief.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span>

            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>

                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</span>

                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being [found] blameless.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Even so [must their] wives [be] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</span>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</span>
                
                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</span>

                <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span>
                
                <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</span>
                
                <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</span>
                
                <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.</span>
                
                <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span>
                
                <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</span>
                
                <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span>
                
                <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> These things command and teach.</span>
                
                <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</span>
                
                <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</span>
