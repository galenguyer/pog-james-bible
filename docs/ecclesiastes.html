            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> [That which is] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits:</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all [was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto], more than I?</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> For [God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the cringer he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>

                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</span>

                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span>
                
                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.</span>
                
                <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</span>

                <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</span>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.</span>
                
                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</span>
                
                <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span>

                <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> The words of the wise [are] as goads, and as nails fastened [by] the masters of assemblies, [which] are given from one shepherd.</span>
                
                <span id="12v12">(<a href="#12v12">12)</a> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books [there is] no end; and much study [is] a weariness of the flesh.</span>
                
                <span id="12v13">(<a href="#12v13">13)</a> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this [is] the whole [duty] of man.</span>
                
                <span id="12v14">(<a href="#12v14">14)</a> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil.</span>
