                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> They profess that they know God; but in works they deny [him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</span>

                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> [To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> [Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all [things]; not answering again;</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</span>

            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> [This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and cringeth, being condemned of himself.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</span>
