                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span>

                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Who [is there] even among you that would shut the doors [for nought]? neither do ye kindle [fire] on mine altar for nought.

                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>

                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And now, O ye priests, this commandment [is] for you.</span>

                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, [even] the dung of your solemn feasts; and [one] shall take you away with it.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him [for] the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he [is] the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?</span>

                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth [it] with good will at your hand.</span>

                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet [is] she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for [one] covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</span>

                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he [is] like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' sope:</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</span>

                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</span>

                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> Ye have said, It [is] vain to serve God: and what profit [is it] that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, [they that] tempt God are even delivered.</span>
