        <p>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</span>

        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found [him], bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their cringes.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and [with] fire:</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, [by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</span>
            
            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v18">(<a href="#4v18">18)</a> And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span>
            
            <span id="4v19">(<a href="#4v19">19)</a> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</span>
            
            <span id="4v20">(<a href="#4v20">20)</a> And they straightway left [their] nets, and followed him.</span>
            
            <span id="4v21">(<a href="#4v21">21)</a> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v22">(<a href="#4v22">22)</a> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v23">(<a href="#4v23">23)</a> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</span>
            
            <span id="4v24">(<a href="#4v24">24)</a> And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v25">(<a href="#4v25">25)</a> And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and [from] Decapolis, and [from] Jerusalem, and [from] Judaea, and [from] beyond Jordan.</span>

            <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</span>
            
            <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;</span>
            
            <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</span>
            
            <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span>
            
            <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</span>
            
            <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span>
            
            <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</span>
            
            <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</span>
            
            <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</span>
            
            <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</span>
            
            <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> And when ye come into an house, salute it.</span>
            
            <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span>
            
            <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</span>
            
            <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="10v16">(<a href="#10v16">16)</a> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span>
            
            <span id="10v17">(<a href="#10v17">17)</a> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</span>
            
            <span id="10v18">(<a href="#10v18">18)</a> And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</span>
            
            <span id="10v19">(<a href="#10v19">19)</a> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</span>
            
            <span id="10v20">(<a href="#10v20">20)</a> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</span>
            
            <span id="10v21">(<a href="#10v21">21)</a> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span>
            
            <span id="10v22">(<a href="#10v22">22)</a> And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</span>
            
            <span id="10v23">(<a href="#10v23">23)</a> But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</span>
            
            <span id="10v24">(<a href="#10v24">24)</a> The disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.</span>
            
            <span id="10v25">(<a href="#10v25">25)</a> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?</span>
            
            <span id="10v26">(<a href="#10v26">26)</a> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</span>

            <span id="10v29">(<a href="#10v29">29)</a> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</span>
            
            <span id="10v30">(<a href="#10v30">30)</a> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span>
            
            <span id="10v31">(<a href="#10v31">31)</a> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</span>
            
            <span id="10v32">(<a href="#10v32">32)</a> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="10v33">(<a href="#10v33">33)</a> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</span>

            <span id="10v38">(<a href="#10v38">38)</a> And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</span>
            
            <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</span>
            
            <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</span>
            
            <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</span>
            
            <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</span>
            
            <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>
            
            <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.</span>
            
            <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> For this is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>
            
            <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span>
            
            <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</span>

            <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</span>

            <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and cringers. But wisdom is justified of her children.</span>

            <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</span>
            
            <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span>
            
            <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</span>
            
            <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span>
            
            <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</span>
            
            <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span>
            
            <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].</span>

            <span id="12v1">(<a href="#12v1">1)</a> At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</span>

            <span id="12v10">(<a href="#12v10">10)</a> And, behold, there was a man which had [his] hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</span>
            
            <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift [it] out?</span>
            
            <span id="12v12">(<a href="#12v12">12)</a> How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</span>

            <span id="14v19">(<a href="#14v19">19)</a> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</span>
            
            <span id="14v20">(<a href="#14v20">20)</a> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</span>

            <span id="16v23">(<a href="#16v23">23)</a> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</span>

            <span id="17v6">(<a href="#17v6">6)</a> And when the disciples heard [it], they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="17v7">(<a href="#17v7">7)</a> And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</span>

            <span id="17v26">(<a href="#17v26">26)</a> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.</span>

            <span id="18v26">(<a href="#18v26">26)</a> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span>

            <span id="18v29">(<a href="#18v29">29)</a> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span>
            
            <span id="18v30">(<a href="#18v30">30)</a> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</span>

            <span id="18v33">(<a href="#18v33">33)</a> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</span>

            <span id="19v20">(<a href="#19v20">20)</a> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</span>
            
            <span id="19v21">(<a href="#19v21">21)</a> Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.</span>
            
            <span id="19v22">(<a href="#19v22">22)</a> But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</span>

            <span id="20v8">(<a href="#20v8">8)</a> So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them [their] hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</span>
            
            <span id="20v9">(<a href="#20v9">9)</a> And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</span>

            <span id="22v3">(<a href="#22v3">3)</a> And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</span>
            
            <span id="22v4">(<a href="#22v4">4)</a> Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.</span>
            
            <span id="22v5">(<a href="#22v5">5)</a> But they made light of [it], and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</span>
            
            <span id="22v6">(<a href="#22v6">6)</a> And the remnant took his servants, and entreated [them] spitefully, and slew [them].</span>
            
            <span id="22v7">(<a href="#22v7">7)</a> But when the king heard [thereof], he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span>
            
            <span id="22v8">(<a href="#22v8">8)</a> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</span>

            <span id="22v13">(<a href="#22v13">13)</a> Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
            
            <span id="22v14">(<a href="#22v14">14)</a> For many are called, but few [are] chosen.</span>

            <span id="22v23">(<a href="#22v23">23)</a> The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</span>

            <span id="22v25">(<a href="#22v25">25)</a> Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</span>
            
            <span id="22v26">(<a href="#22v26">26)</a> Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</span>
            
            <span id="22v27">(<a href="#22v27">27)</a> And last of all the woman died also.</span>
            
            <span id="22v28">(<a href="#22v28">28)</a> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span>
            
            <span id="22v29">(<a href="#22v29">29)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</span>
            
            <span id="22v30">(<a href="#22v30">30)</a> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="22v31">(<a href="#22v31">31)</a> But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</span>

            <span id="22v34">(<a href="#22v34">34)</a> But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</span>
            
            <span id="22v35">(<a href="#22v35">35)</a> Then one of them, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,</span>
            
            <span id="22v36">(<a href="#22v36">36)</a> Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?</span>
            
            <span id="22v37">(<a href="#22v37">37)</a> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span>
            
            <span id="22v38">(<a href="#22v38">38)</a> This is the first and great commandment.</span>

            <span id="22v41">(<a href="#22v41">41)</a> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span>

            <span id="22v44">(<a href="#22v44">44)</a> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span>

            <span id="25v24">(<a href="#25v24">24)</a> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span>
            
            <span id="25v25">(<a href="#25v25">25)</a> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [that is] thine.</span>
            
            <span id="25v26">(<a href="#25v26">26)</a> His lord answered and said unto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span>
            
            <span id="25v27">(<a href="#25v27">27)</a> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span>

            <span id="26v9">(<a href="#26v9">9)</a> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span>
            
            <span id="26v10">(<a href="#26v10">10)</a> When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>
            
            <span id="26v11">(<a href="#26v11">11)</a> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
            
            <span id="26v12">(<a href="#26v12">12)</a> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.</span>
            
            <span id="26v13">(<a href="#26v13">13)</a> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v14">(<a href="#26v14">14)</a> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span>
            
            <span id="26v15">(<a href="#26v15">15)</a> And said [unto them], What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span>
            
            <span id="26v16">(<a href="#26v16">16)</a> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v17">(<a href="#26v17">17)</a> Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span>
            
            <span id="26v18">(<a href="#26v18">18)</a> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span>
            
            <span id="26v19">(<a href="#26v19">19)</a> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span>
            
            <span id="26v20">(<a href="#26v20">20)</a> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span>
            
            <span id="26v21">(<a href="#26v21">21)</a> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>
            
            <span id="26v22">(<a href="#26v22">22)</a> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span>
            
            <span id="26v23">(<a href="#26v23">23)</a> And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span>
            
            <span id="26v24">(<a href="#26v24">24)</a> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>
            
            <span id="26v25">(<a href="#26v25">25)</a> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v26">(<a href="#26v26">26)</a> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it], and brake [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span>
            
            <span id="26v27">(<a href="#26v27">27)</a> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span>
            
            <span id="26v28">(<a href="#26v28">28)</a> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="26v29">(<a href="#26v29">29)</a> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span>
            
            <span id="26v30">(<a href="#26v30">30)</a> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span>
            
            <span id="26v31">(<a href="#26v31">31)</a> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span>
            
            <span id="26v32">(<a href="#26v32">32)</a> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="26v33">(<a href="#26v33">33)</a> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.</span>
            
            <span id="26v34">(<a href="#26v34">34)</a> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
            
            <span id="26v35">(<a href="#26v35">35)</a> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v36">(<a href="#26v36">36)</a> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span>
            
            <span id="26v37">(<a href="#26v37">37)</a> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span>
            
            <span id="26v38">(<a href="#26v38">38)</a> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span>
            
            <span id="26v39">(<a href="#26v39">39)</a> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</span>
            
            <span id="26v40">(<a href="#26v40">40)</a> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span>
            
            <span id="26v41">(<a href="#26v41">41)</a> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.</span>
            
            <span id="26v42">(<a href="#26v42">42)</a> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span>
            
            <span id="26v43">(<a href="#26v43">43)</a> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span>
            
            <span id="26v44">(<a href="#26v44">44)</a> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span>
            
            <span id="26v45">(<a href="#26v45">45)</a> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of cringers.</span>
            
            <span id="26v46">(<a href="#26v46">46)</a> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v47">(<a href="#26v47">47)</a> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span>
            
            <span id="26v48">(<a href="#26v48">48)</a> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span>
            
            <span id="26v49">(<a href="#26v49">49)</a> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span>
            
            <span id="26v50">(<a href="#26v50">50)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span>
            
            <span id="26v51">(<a href="#26v51">51)</a> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</span>
            
            <span id="26v52">(<a href="#26v52">52)</a> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span>
            
            <span id="26v53">(<a href="#26v53">53)</a> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>
            
            <span id="26v54">(<a href="#26v54">54)</a> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span>
            
            <span id="26v55">(<a href="#26v55">55)</a> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span>
            
            <span id="26v56">(<a href="#26v56">56)</a> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v57">(<a href="#26v57">57)</a> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span>
            
            <span id="26v58">(<a href="#26v58">58)</a> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span>
            
            <span id="26v59">(<a href="#26v59">59)</a> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span>
            
            <span id="26v60">(<a href="#26v60">60)</a> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</span>
            
            <span id="26v61">(<a href="#26v61">61)</a> And said, This [fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span>
            
            <span id="26v62">(<a href="#26v62">62)</a> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] these witness against thee?</span>
            
            <span id="26v63">(<a href="#26v63">63)</a> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="26v64">(<a href="#26v64">64)</a> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="26v65">(<a href="#26v65">65)</a> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span>
            
            <span id="26v66">(<a href="#26v66">66)</a> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span>
            
            <span id="26v67">(<a href="#26v67">67)</a> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,</span>
            
            <span id="26v68">(<a href="#26v68">68)</a> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="26v69">(<a href="#26v69">69)</a> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="26v70">(<a href="#26v70">70)</a> But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span>
            
            <span id="26v71">(<a href="#26v71">71)</a> And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span>
            
            <span id="26v72">(<a href="#26v72">72)</a> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span>
            
            <span id="26v73">(<a href="#26v73">73)</a> And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</span>
            
            <span id="26v74">(<a href="#26v74">74)</a> Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span>
            
            <span id="26v75">(<a href="#26v75">75)</a> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="27"><a href="#27">Chapter 27</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v1">(<a href="#27v1">1)</a> When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</span>
            
            <span id="27v2">(<a href="#27v2">2)</a> And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v3">(<a href="#27v3">3)</a> Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</span>
            
            <span id="27v4">(<a href="#27v4">4)</a> Saying, I have cringed in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What [is that] to us? see thou [to that].</span>
            
            <span id="27v5">(<a href="#27v5">5)</a> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span>
            
            <span id="27v6">(<a href="#27v6">6)</a> And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span>
            
            <span id="27v7">(<a href="#27v7">7)</a> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</span>
            
            <span id="27v8">(<a href="#27v8">8)</a> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</span>
            
            <span id="27v9">(<a href="#27v9">9)</a> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</span>
            
            <span id="27v10">(<a href="#27v10">10)</a> And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</span>
            
            <span id="27v11">(<a href="#27v11">11)</a> And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</span>
            
            <span id="27v12">(<a href="#27v12">12)</a> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="27v13">(<a href="#27v13">13)</a> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</span>
            
            <span id="27v14">(<a href="#27v14">14)</a> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</span>
            
            <span id="27v15">(<a href="#27v15">15)</a> Now at [that] feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</span>
            
            <span id="27v16">(<a href="#27v16">16)</a> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span>
            
            <span id="27v17">(<a href="#27v17">17)</a> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</span>
            
            <span id="27v18">(<a href="#27v18">18)</a> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="27v19">(<a href="#27v19">19)</a> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</span>
            
            <span id="27v20">(<a href="#27v20">20)</a> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="27v21">(<a href="#27v21">21)</a> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</span>
            
            <span id="27v22">(<a href="#27v22">22)</a> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? [They] all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</span>
            
            <span id="27v23">(<a href="#27v23">23)</a> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v24">(<a href="#27v24">24)</a> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye [to it].</span>
            
            <span id="27v25">(<a href="#27v25">25)</a> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v26">(<a href="#27v26">26)</a> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.</span>
            
            <span id="27v27">(<a href="#27v27">27)</a> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band [of soldiers].</span>
            
            <span id="27v28">(<a href="#27v28">28)</a> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v29">(<a href="#27v29">29)</a> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span>
            
            <span id="27v30">(<a href="#27v30">30)</a> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</span>
            
            <span id="27v31">(<a href="#27v31">31)</a> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him].</span>
            
            <span id="27v32">(<a href="#27v32">32)</a> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</span>
            
            <span id="27v33">(<a href="#27v33">33)</a> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v34">(<a href="#27v34">34)</a> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.</span>
            
            <span id="27v35">(<a href="#27v35">35)</a> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</span>
            
            <span id="27v36">(<a href="#27v36">36)</a> And sitting down they watched him there;</span>
            
            <span id="27v37">(<a href="#27v37">37)</a> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
            
            <span id="27v38">(<a href="#27v38">38)</a> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v39">(<a href="#27v39">39)</a> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</span>
            
            <span id="27v40">(<a href="#27v40">40)</a> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</span>
            
            <span id="27v41">(<a href="#27v41">41)</a> Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,</span>
            
            <span id="27v42">(<a href="#27v42">42)</a> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</span>
            
            <span id="27v43">(<a href="#27v43">43)</a> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="27v44">(<a href="#27v44">44)</a> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</span>
            
            <span id="27v45">(<a href="#27v45">45)</a> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span>
            
            <span id="27v46">(<a href="#27v46">46)</a> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span>
            
            <span id="27v47">(<a href="#27v47">47)</a> Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for Elias.</span>
            
            <span id="27v48">(<a href="#27v48">48)</a> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span>
            
            <span id="27v49">(<a href="#27v49">49)</a> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v50">(<a href="#27v50">50)</a> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="27v51">(<a href="#27v51">51)</a> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</span>
            
            <span id="27v52">(<a href="#27v52">52)</a> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</span>
            
            <span id="27v53">(<a href="#27v53">53)</a> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</span>
            
            <span id="27v54">(<a href="#27v54">54)</a> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="27v55">(<a href="#27v55">55)</a> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</span>
            
            <span id="27v56">(<a href="#27v56">56)</a> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.</span>
            
            <span id="27v57">(<a href="#27v57">57)</a> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</span>
            
            <span id="27v58">(<a href="#27v58">58)</a> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</span>
            
            <span id="27v59">(<a href="#27v59">59)</a> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span>
            
            <span id="27v60">(<a href="#27v60">60)</a> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</span>
            
            <span id="27v61">(<a href="#27v61">61)</a> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="27v62">(<a href="#27v62">62)</a> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</span>
            
            <span id="27v63">(<a href="#27v63">63)</a> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</span>
            
            <span id="27v64">(<a href="#27v64">64)</a> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</span>
            
            <span id="27v65">(<a href="#27v65">65)</a> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make [it] as sure as ye can.</span>
            
            <span id="27v66">(<a href="#27v66">66)</a> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="28"><a href="#28">Chapter 28</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="28v1">(<a href="#28v1">1)</a> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</span>
            
            <span id="28v2">(<a href="#28v2">2)</a> And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</span>
            
            <span id="28v3">(<a href="#28v3">3)</a> His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span>
            
            <span id="28v4">(<a href="#28v4">4)</a> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men].</span>
            
            <span id="28v5">(<a href="#28v5">5)</a> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span>
            
            <span id="28v6">(<a href="#28v6">6)</a> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span>
            
            <span id="28v7">(<a href="#28v7">7)</a> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span>
            
            <span id="28v8">(<a href="#28v8">8)</a> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="28v9">(<a href="#28v9">9)</a> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span>
            
            <span id="28v10">(<a href="#28v10">10)</a> Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="28v11">(<a href="#28v11">11)</a> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span>
            
            <span id="28v12">(<a href="#28v12">12)</a> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span>
            
            <span id="28v13">(<a href="#28v13">13)</a> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.</span>
            
            <span id="28v14">(<a href="#28v14">14)</a> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span>
            
            <span id="28v15">(<a href="#28v15">15)</a> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="28v16">(<a href="#28v16">16)</a> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span>
            
            <span id="28v17">(<a href="#28v17">17)</a> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</span>
            
            <span id="28v18">(<a href="#28v18">18)</a> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="28v19">(<a href="#28v19">19)</a> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span>
