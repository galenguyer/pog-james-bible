            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> The same was in the beginning with God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> [That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the cringe of the world.</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</span>
            
            <span id="1v37">(<a href="#1v37">37)</a> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="1v38">(<a href="#1v38">38)</a> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span>
            
            <span id="1v39">(<a href="#1v39">39)</a> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</span>
            
            <span id="1v40">(<a href="#1v40">40)</a> One of the two which heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span>
            
            <span id="1v41">(<a href="#1v41">41)</a> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v42">(<a href="#1v42">42)</a> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v43">(<a href="#1v43">43)</a> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</span>
            
            <span id="1v44">(<a href="#1v44">44)</a> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span>
            
            <span id="1v45">(<a href="#1v45">45)</a> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span>
            
            <span id="1v46">(<a href="#1v46">46)</a> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</span>
            
            <span id="1v47">(<a href="#1v47">47)</a> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span>
            
            <span id="1v48">(<a href="#1v48">48)</a> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v49">(<a href="#1v49">49)</a> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="1v50">(<a href="#1v50">50)</a> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span>
            
            <span id="1v51">(<a href="#1v51">51)</a> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span>

        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it].</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> But he spake of the temple of his body.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</span>
            
            <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],</span>
            
            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</span>

        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span>

        <p>

            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span>

            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> For John was not yet cast into prison.</span>

            <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> And he must needs go through Samaria.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</span>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</span>
            
            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>
            
            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span>
            
            <span id="4v18">(<a href="#4v18">18)</a> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span>
            
            <span id="4v19">(<a href="#4v19">19)</a> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="4v20">(<a href="#4v20">20)</a> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span>
            
            <span id="4v21">(<a href="#4v21">21)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span>
            
            <span id="4v22">(<a href="#4v22">22)</a> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span>
            
            <span id="4v23">(<a href="#4v23">23)</a> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>
            
            <span id="4v24">(<a href="#4v24">24)</a> God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</span>
            
            <span id="4v25">(<a href="#4v25">25)</a> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span>
            
            <span id="4v26">(<a href="#4v26">26)</a> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v27">(<a href="#4v27">27)</a> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</span>
            
            <span id="4v28">(<a href="#4v28">28)</a> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</span>
            
            <span id="4v29">(<a href="#4v29">29)</a> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</span>
            
            <span id="4v30">(<a href="#4v30">30)</a> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v31">(<a href="#4v31">31)</a> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</span>
            
            <span id="4v32">(<a href="#4v32">32)</a> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span>
            
            <span id="4v33">(<a href="#4v33">33)</a> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?</span>
            
            <span id="4v34">(<a href="#4v34">34)</a> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span>
            
            <span id="4v35">(<a href="#4v35">35)</a> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span>
            
            <span id="4v36">(<a href="#4v36">36)</a> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span>
            
            <span id="4v37">(<a href="#4v37">37)</a> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span>
            
            <span id="4v38">(<a href="#4v38">38)</a> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v39">(<a href="#4v39">39)</a> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</span>
            
            <span id="4v40">(<a href="#4v40">40)</a> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</span>
            
            <span id="4v41">(<a href="#4v41">41)</a> And many more believed because of his own word;</span>
            
            <span id="4v42">(<a href="#4v42">42)</a> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v43">(<a href="#4v43">43)</a> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="4v44">(<a href="#4v44">44)</a> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</span>
            
            <span id="4v45">(<a href="#4v45">45)</a> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span>
            
            <span id="4v46">(<a href="#4v46">46)</a> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span>
            
            <span id="4v47">(<a href="#4v47">47)</a> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span>
            
            <span id="4v48">(<a href="#4v48">48)</a> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span>
            
            <span id="4v49">(<a href="#4v49">49)</a> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span>
            
            <span id="4v50">(<a href="#4v50">50)</a> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</span>
            
            <span id="4v51">(<a href="#4v51">51)</a> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.</span>
            
            <span id="4v52">(<a href="#4v52">52)</a> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span>
            
            <span id="4v53">(<a href="#4v53">53)</a> So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span>
            
            <span id="4v54">(<a href="#4v54">54)</a> This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.</span>
            
            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
            
            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.</span>
            
            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: cringe no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</span>
            
            <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v17">(<a href="#5v17">17)</a> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span>
            
            <span id="5v18">(<a href="#5v18">18)</a> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</span>
            
            <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span>
            
            <span id="5v20">(<a href="#5v20">20)</a> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span>
            
            <span id="5v21">(<a href="#5v21">21)</a> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span>
            
            <span id="5v22">(<a href="#5v22">22)</a> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span>
            
            <span id="5v23">(<a href="#5v23">23)</a> That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span>
            
            <span id="5v24">(<a href="#5v24">24)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span>
            
            <span id="5v25">(<a href="#5v25">25)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span>
            
            <span id="5v26">(<a href="#5v26">26)</a> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span>
            
            <span id="5v27">(<a href="#5v27">27)</a> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span>

            <span id="6v1">(<a href="#6v1">1)</a> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.</span>
            
            <span id="6v2">(<a href="#6v2">2)</a> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</span>
            
            <span id="6v3">(<a href="#6v3">3)</a> And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</span>
            
            <span id="6v4">(<a href="#6v4">4)</a> And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="6v5">(<a href="#6v5">5)</a> When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span>
            
            <span id="6v6">(<a href="#6v6">6)</a> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</span>
            
            <span id="6v7">(<a href="#6v7">7)</a> Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</span>
            
            <span id="6v8">(<a href="#6v8">8)</a> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,</span>
            
            <span id="6v9">(<a href="#6v9">9)</a> There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</span>
            
            <span id="6v10">(<a href="#6v10">10)</a> And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span>
            
            <span id="6v11">(<a href="#6v11">11)</a> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</span>
            
            <span id="6v12">(<a href="#6v12">12)</a> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</span>
            
            <span id="6v13">(<a href="#6v13">13)</a> Therefore they gathered [them] together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</span>
            
            <span id="6v14">(<a href="#6v14">14)</a> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v15">(<a href="#6v15">15)</a> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</span>
            
            <span id="6v16">(<a href="#6v16">16)</a> And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</span>
            
            <span id="6v17">(<a href="#6v17">17)</a> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</span>
            
            <span id="6v18">(<a href="#6v18">18)</a> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</span>
            
            <span id="6v19">(<a href="#6v19">19)</a> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="6v20">(<a href="#6v20">20)</a> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="6v21">(<a href="#6v21">21)</a> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</span>

            <span id="6v22">(<a href="#6v22">22)</a> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;</span>
            
            <span id="6v23">(<a href="#6v23">23)</a> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</span>
            
            <span id="6v24">(<a href="#6v24">24)</a> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="6v25">(<a href="#6v25">25)</a> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span>
            
            <span id="6v26">(<a href="#6v26">26)</a> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</span>
            
            <span id="6v27">(<a href="#6v27">27)</a> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</span>
            
            <span id="6v28">(<a href="#6v28">28)</a> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</span>
            
            <span id="6v29">(<a href="#6v29">29)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span>
            
            <span id="6v30">(<a href="#6v30">30)</a> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</span>
            
            <span id="6v31">(<a href="#6v31">31)</a> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</span>
            
            <span id="6v32">(<a href="#6v32">32)</a> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="6v33">(<a href="#6v33">33)</a> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</span>
            
            <span id="6v34">(<a href="#6v34">34)</a> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</span>
            
            <span id="6v35">(<a href="#6v35">35)</a> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</span>
            
            <span id="6v36">(<a href="#6v36">36)</a> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</span>
            
            <span id="6v37">(<a href="#6v37">37)</a> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</span>
            
            <span id="6v38">(<a href="#6v38">38)</a> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="6v39">(<a href="#6v39">39)</a> And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</span>
            
            <span id="6v40">(<a href="#6v40">40)</a> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
            
            <span id="6v41">(<a href="#6v41">41)</a> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="6v42">(<a href="#6v42">42)</a> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</span>
            
            <span id="6v43">(<a href="#6v43">43)</a> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</span>
            
            <span id="6v44">(<a href="#6v44">44)</a> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
            
            <span id="6v45">(<a href="#6v45">45)</a> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="6v46">(<a href="#6v46">46)</a> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</span>
            
            <span id="6v47">(<a href="#6v47">47)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</span>
            
            <span id="6v48">(<a href="#6v48">48)</a> I am that bread of life.</span>
            
            <span id="6v49">(<a href="#6v49">49)</a> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</span>
            
            <span id="6v50">(<a href="#6v50">50)</a> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</span>
            
            <span id="6v51">(<a href="#6v51">51)</a> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span>
            
            <span id="6v52">(<a href="#6v52">52)</a> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?</span>
            
            <span id="6v53">(<a href="#6v53">53)</a> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</span>
            
            <span id="6v54">(<a href="#6v54">54)</a> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
            
            <span id="6v55">(<a href="#6v55">55)</a> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span>
            
            <span id="6v56">(<a href="#6v56">56)</a> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v57">(<a href="#6v57">57)</a> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</span>
            
            <span id="6v58">(<a href="#6v58">58)</a> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</span>
            
            <span id="6v59">(<a href="#6v59">59)</a> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</span>
            
            <span id="6v60">(<a href="#6v60">60)</a> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this], said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</span>
            
            <span id="6v61">(<a href="#6v61">61)</a> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</span>
            
            <span id="6v62">(<a href="#6v62">62)</a> [What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</span>
            
            <span id="6v63">(<a href="#6v63">63)</a> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.</span>
            
            <span id="6v64">(<a href="#6v64">64)</a> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v65">(<a href="#6v65">65)</a> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="6v66">(<a href="#6v66">66)</a> From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v67">(<a href="#6v67">67)</a> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</span>

            <span id="6v70">(<a href="#6v70">70)</a> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span>
            
            <span id="6v71">(<a href="#6v71">71)</a> He spake of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</span>

            <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span>
            
            <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span>
            
            <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span>
            
            <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</span>
            
            <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span>
            
            <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span>
            
            <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or [whether] I speak of myself.</span>
            
            <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span>
            
            <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span>
            
            <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span>
            
            <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span>
            
            <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span>
            
            <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span>
            
            <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span>
            
            <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span>
            
            <span id="7v26">(<a href="#7v26">26)</a> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span>
            
            <span id="7v27">(<a href="#7v27">27)</a> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span>
            
            <span id="7v28">(<a href="#7v28">28)</a> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span>
            
            <span id="7v29">(<a href="#7v29">29)</a> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="7v30">(<a href="#7v30">30)</a> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span>
            
            <span id="7v31">(<a href="#7v31">31)</a> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v32">(<a href="#7v32">32)</a> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span>
            
            <span id="7v33">(<a href="#7v33">33)</a> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="7v34">(<a href="#7v34">34)</a> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.</span>
            
            <span id="7v35">(<a href="#7v35">35)</a> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span>
            
            <span id="7v36">(<a href="#7v36">36)</a> What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?</span>
            
            <span id="7v37">(<a href="#7v37">37)</a> In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span>
            
            <span id="7v38">(<a href="#7v38">38)</a> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span>
            
            <span id="7v39">(<a href="#7v39">39)</a> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given]; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v40">(<a href="#7v40">40)</a> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="7v41">(<a href="#7v41">41)</a> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span>
            
            <span id="7v42">(<a href="#7v42">42)</a> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span>
            
            <span id="7v43">(<a href="#7v43">43)</a> So there was a division among the people because of him.</span>
            
            <span id="7v44">(<a href="#7v44">44)</a> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v45">(<a href="#7v45">45)</a> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span>
            
            <span id="7v46">(<a href="#7v46">46)</a> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span>
            
            <span id="7v47">(<a href="#7v47">47)</a> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</span>
            
            <span id="7v48">(<a href="#7v48">48)</a> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span>
            
            <span id="7v49">(<a href="#7v49">49)</a> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</span>
            
            <span id="7v50">(<a href="#7v50">50)</a> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span>
            
            <span id="7v51">(<a href="#7v51">51)</a> Doth our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</span>
            
            <span id="7v52">(<a href="#7v52">52)</a> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="7v53">(<a href="#7v53">53)</a> And every man went unto his own house.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="8"><a href="#8">Chapter 8</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span>
            
            <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span>
            
            <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</span>
            
            <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</span>
            
            <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</span>
            
            <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].</span>
            
            <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without cringe among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span>
            
            <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span>
            
            <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span>
            
            <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span>
            
            <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and cringe no more.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span>
            
            <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</span>
            
            <span id="8v14">(<a href="#8v14">14)</a> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>
            
            <span id="8v15">(<a href="#8v15">15)</a> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span>
            
            <span id="8v16">(<a href="#8v16">16)</a> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="8v17">(<a href="#8v17">17)</a> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span>
            
            <span id="8v18">(<a href="#8v18">18)</a> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span>
            
            <span id="8v19">(<a href="#8v19">19)</a> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span>
            
            <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</span>
            
            <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your cringes: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
            
            <span id="8v22">(<a href="#8v22">22)</a> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span>
            
            <span id="8v23">(<a href="#8v23">23)</a> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>
            
            <span id="8v24">(<a href="#8v24">24)</a> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your cringes: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>
            
            <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>
            
            <span id="8v27">(<a href="#8v27">27)</a> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</span>
            
            <span id="8v28">(<a href="#8v28">28)</a> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span>
            
            <span id="8v29">(<a href="#8v29">29)</a> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span>
            
            <span id="8v30">(<a href="#8v30">30)</a> As he spake these words, many believed on him.</span>
            
            <span id="8v31">(<a href="#8v31">31)</a> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;</span>
            
            <span id="8v32">(<a href="#8v32">32)</a> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v33">(<a href="#8v33">33)</a> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span>
            
            <span id="8v34">(<a href="#8v34">34)</a> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth cringe is the servant of cringe.</span>
            
            <span id="8v35">(<a href="#8v35">35)</a> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.</span>
            
            <span id="8v36">(<a href="#8v36">36)</a> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span>
            
            <span id="8v37">(<a href="#8v37">37)</a> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span>
            
            <span id="8v38">(<a href="#8v38">38)</a> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span>
            
            <span id="8v39">(<a href="#8v39">39)</a> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="8v40">(<a href="#8v40">40)</a> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="8v41">(<a href="#8v41">41)</a> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</span>
            
            <span id="8v42">(<a href="#8v42">42)</a> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="8v43">(<a href="#8v43">43)</a> Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.</span>
            
            <span id="8v44">(<a href="#8v44">44)</a> Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>
            
            <span id="8v45">(<a href="#8v45">45)</a> And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.</span>
            
            <span id="8v46">(<a href="#8v46">46)</a> Which of you convinceth me of cringe? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span>
            
            <span id="8v47">(<a href="#8v47">47)</a> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</span>
            
            <span id="8v48">(<a href="#8v48">48)</a> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span>
            
            <span id="8v49">(<a href="#8v49">49)</a> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span>
            
            <span id="8v50">(<a href="#8v50">50)</a> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>
            
            <span id="8v51">(<a href="#8v51">51)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span>
            
            <span id="8v52">(<a href="#8v52">52)</a> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span>

            <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</span>
            
            <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</span>

            <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</span>
            
            <span id="9v16">(<a href="#9v16">16)</a> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a cringer do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</span>
            
            <span id="9v17">(<a href="#9v17">17)</a> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</span>

            <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span>
            
            <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a cringer.</span>

            <span id="9v26">(<a href="#9v26">26)</a> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span>
            
            <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?</span>
            
            <span id="9v28">(<a href="#9v28">28)</a> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</span>

            <span id="9v31">(<a href="#9v31">31)</a> Now we know that God heareth not cringers: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</span>
            
            <span id="9v32">(<a href="#9v32">32)</a> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</span>

            <span id="9v34">(<a href="#9v34">34)</a> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in cringes, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span>
            
            <span id="9v35">(<a href="#9v35">35)</a> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>
            
            <span id="9v36">(<a href="#9v36">36)</a> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</span>
            
            <span id="9v37">(<a href="#9v37">37)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>
            
            <span id="9v38">(<a href="#9v38">38)</a> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="9v39">(<a href="#9v39">39)</a> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span>
            
            <span id="9v40">(<a href="#9v40">40)</a> And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</span>
            
            <span id="9v41">(<a href="#9v41">41)</a> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no cringe: but now ye say, We see; therefore your cringe remaineth.</span>

            <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</span>
            
            <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</span>
            
            <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</span>
            
            <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</span>
            
            <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four days already.</span>
            
            <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</span>
            
            <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span>
            
            <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat [still] in the house.</span>
            
            <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span>
            
            <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee.</span>
            
            <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</span>
            
            <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</span>
            
            <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span>
            
            <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</span>
            
            <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</span>
            
            <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</span>
            
            <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly, and came unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</span>
            
            <span id="11v32">(<a href="#11v32">32)</a> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span>
            
            <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</span>
            
            <span id="11v34">(<a href="#11v34">34)</a> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</span>
            
            <span id="11v35">(<a href="#11v35">35)</a> Jesus wept.</span>
            
            <span id="11v36">(<a href="#11v36">36)</a> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</span>
            
            <span id="11v37">(<a href="#11v37">37)</a> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</span>
            
            <span id="11v38">(<a href="#11v38">38)</a> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</span>
            
            <span id="11v39">(<a href="#11v39">39)</a> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been [dead] four days.</span>
            
            <span id="11v40">(<a href="#11v40">40)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span>
            
            <span id="11v41">(<a href="#11v41">41)</a> Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span>
            
            <span id="11v42">(<a href="#11v42">42)</a> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="11v43">(<a href="#11v43">43)</a> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</span>
            
            <span id="11v44">(<a href="#11v44">44)</a> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</span>
            
            <span id="11v45">(<a href="#11v45">45)</a> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v46">(<a href="#11v46">46)</a> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="11v47">(<a href="#11v47">47)</a> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</span>
            
            <span id="11v48">(<a href="#11v48">48)</a> If we let him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</span>
            
            <span id="11v49">(<a href="#11v49">49)</a> And one of them, [named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</span>
            
            <span id="11v50">(<a href="#11v50">50)</a> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</span>
            
            <span id="11v51">(<a href="#11v51">51)</a> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</span>
            
            <span id="11v52">(<a href="#11v52">52)</a> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</span>
            
            <span id="11v53">(<a href="#11v53">53)</a> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</span>
            
            <span id="11v54">(<a href="#11v54">54)</a> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="11v55">(<a href="#11v55">55)</a> And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</span>
            
            <span id="11v56">(<a href="#11v56">56)</a> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</span>
            
            <span id="11v57">(<a href="#11v57">57)</a> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew [it], that they might take him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="12"><a href="#12">Chapter 12</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v1">(<a href="#12v1">1)</a> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</span>
            
            <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</span>
            
            <span id="12v3">(<a href="#12v3">3)</a> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</span>
            
            <span id="12v4">(<a href="#12v4">4)</a> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], which should betray him,</span>
            
            <span id="12v5">(<a href="#12v5">5)</a> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span>
            
            <span id="12v6">(<a href="#12v6">6)</a> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</span>
            
            <span id="12v7">(<a href="#12v7">7)</a> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span>
            
            <span id="12v8">(<a href="#12v8">8)</a> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
            
            <span id="12v9">(<a href="#12v9">9)</a> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v10">(<a href="#12v10">10)</a> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</span>
            
            <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v12">(<a href="#12v12">12)</a> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span>
            
            <span id="12v13">(<a href="#12v13">13)</a> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="12v14">(<a href="#12v14">14)</a> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</span>
            
            <span id="12v15">(<a href="#12v15">15)</a> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</span>
            
            <span id="12v16">(<a href="#12v16">16)</a> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="12v17">(<a href="#12v17">17)</a> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</span>
            
            <span id="12v18">(<a href="#12v18">18)</a> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</span>
            
            <span id="12v19">(<a href="#12v19">19)</a> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v20">(<a href="#12v20">20)</a> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</span>
            
            <span id="12v21">(<a href="#12v21">21)</a> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="12v22">(<a href="#12v22">22)</a> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v23">(<a href="#12v23">23)</a> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span>
            
            <span id="12v24">(<a href="#12v24">24)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span>
            
            <span id="12v25">(<a href="#12v25">25)</a> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</span>
            
            <span id="12v26">(<a href="#12v26">26)</a> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.</span>
            
            <span id="12v27">(<a href="#12v27">27)</a> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>
            
            <span id="12v28">(<a href="#12v28">28)</a> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.</span>
            
            <span id="12v29">(<a href="#12v29">29)</a> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</span>
            
            <span id="12v30">(<a href="#12v30">30)</a> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span>
            
            <span id="12v31">(<a href="#12v31">31)</a> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span>
            
            <span id="12v32">(<a href="#12v32">32)</a> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="12v33">(<a href="#12v33">33)</a> This he said, signifying what death he should die.</span>
            
            <span id="12v34">(<a href="#12v34">34)</a> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</span>
            
            <span id="12v35">(<a href="#12v35">35)</a> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>
            
            <span id="12v36">(<a href="#12v36">36)</a> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v37">(<a href="#12v37">37)</a> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</span>
            
            <span id="12v38">(<a href="#12v38">38)</a> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span>
            
            <span id="12v39">(<a href="#12v39">39)</a> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</span>
            
            <span id="12v40">(<a href="#12v40">40)</a> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span>
            
            <span id="12v41">(<a href="#12v41">41)</a> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v42">(<a href="#12v42">42)</a> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span>
            
            <span id="12v43">(<a href="#12v43">43)</a> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v44">(<a href="#12v44">44)</a> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="12v45">(<a href="#12v45">45)</a> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="12v46">(<a href="#12v46">46)</a> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</span>

            <span id="13v1">(<a href="#13v1">1)</a> Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</span>
            
            <span id="13v2">(<a href="#13v2">2)</a> And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], to betray him;</span>
            
            <span id="13v3">(<a href="#13v3">3)</a> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</span>
            
            <span id="13v4">(<a href="#13v4">4)</a> He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</span>
            
            <span id="13v5">(<a href="#13v5">5)</a> After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel wherewith he was girded.</span>
            
            <span id="13v6">(<a href="#13v6">6)</a> Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span>
            
            <span id="13v7">(<a href="#13v7">7)</a> Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</span>
            
            <span id="13v8">(<a href="#13v8">8)</a> Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span>
            
            <span id="13v9">(<a href="#13v9">9)</a> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.</span>
            
            <span id="13v10">(<a href="#13v10">10)</a> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</span>
            
            <span id="13v11">(<a href="#13v11">11)</a> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</span>
            
            <span id="13v12">(<a href="#13v12">12)</a> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</span>
            
            <span id="13v13">(<a href="#13v13">13)</a> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.</span>

            <span id="13v18">(<a href="#13v18">18)</a> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</span>
            
            <span id="13v19">(<a href="#13v19">19)</a> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].</span>
            
            <span id="13v20">(<a href="#13v20">20)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</span>
            
            <span id="13v21">(<a href="#13v21">21)</a> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>
            
            <span id="13v22">(<a href="#13v22">22)</a> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</span>
            
            <span id="13v23">(<a href="#13v23">23)</a> Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span>
            
            <span id="13v24">(<a href="#13v24">24)</a> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</span>
            
            <span id="13v25">(<a href="#13v25">25)</a> He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</span>
            
            <span id="13v26">(<a href="#13v26">26)</a> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.</span>
            
            <span id="13v27">(<a href="#13v27">27)</a> And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</span>
            
            <span id="13v28">(<a href="#13v28">28)</a> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="13v29">(<a href="#13v29">29)</a> For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</span>
            
            <span id="13v30">(<a href="#13v30">30)</a> He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="13v31">(<a href="#13v31">31)</a> Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span>
            
            <span id="13v32">(<a href="#13v32">32)</a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</span>

            <span id="13v36">(<a href="#13v36">36)</a> Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</span>
            
            <span id="13v37">(<a href="#13v37">37)</a> Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</span>

            <span id="18v5">(<a href="#18v5">5)</a> They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</span>
            
            <span id="18v6">(<a href="#18v6">6)</a> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.</span>

            <span id="18v10">(<a href="#18v10">10)</a> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span>
            
            <span id="18v11">(<a href="#18v11">11)</a> Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span>
            
            <span id="18v12">(<a href="#18v12">12)</a> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</span>
            
            <span id="18v13">(<a href="#18v13">13)</a> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</span>
            
            <span id="18v14">(<a href="#18v14">14)</a> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span>

            <span id="18v15">(<a href="#18v15">15)</a> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</span>
            
            <span id="18v16">(<a href="#18v16">16)</a> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</span>
            
            <span id="18v17">(<a href="#18v17">17)</a> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also [one] of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="18v19">(<a href="#18v19">19)</a> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</span>
            
            <span id="18v20">(<a href="#18v20">20)</a> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="18v21">(<a href="#18v21">21)</a> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</span>
            
            <span id="18v22">(<a href="#18v22">22)</a> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</span>
            
            <span id="18v23">(<a href="#18v23">23)</a> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</span>
            
            <span id="18v24">(<a href="#18v24">24)</a> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</span>
            
            <span id="18v25">(<a href="#18v25">25)</a> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it], and said, I am not.</span>
            
            <span id="18v26">(<a href="#18v26">26)</a> One of the servants of the high priest, being [his] kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</span>
            
            <span id="18v27">(<a href="#18v27">27)</a> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="18v28">(<a href="#18v28">28)</a> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</span>
            
            <span id="18v29">(<a href="#18v29">29)</a> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</span>
            
            <span id="18v30">(<a href="#18v30">30)</a> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="18v31">(<a href="#18v31">31)</a> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</span>
            
            <span id="18v32">(<a href="#18v32">32)</a> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</span>
            
            <span id="18v33">(<a href="#18v33">33)</a> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</span>
            
            <span id="18v34">(<a href="#18v34">34)</a> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</span>
            
            <span id="18v35">(<a href="#18v35">35)</a> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</span>
            
            <span id="18v36">(<a href="#18v36">36)</a> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</span>
            
            <span id="18v37">(<a href="#18v37">37)</a> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</span>
            
            <span id="18v38">(<a href="#18v38">38)</a> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault [at all].</span>
            
            <span id="18v39">(<a href="#18v39">39)</a> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span>
            
            <span id="18v40">(<a href="#18v40">40)</a> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span>

            <span id="19v1">(<a href="#19v1">1)</a> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him].</span>
            
            <span id="19v2">(<a href="#19v2">2)</a> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</span>
            
            <span id="19v3">(<a href="#19v3">3)</a> And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</span>

            <span id="19v7">(<a href="#19v7">7)</a> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v8">(<a href="#19v8">8)</a> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</span>
            
            <span id="19v9">(<a href="#19v9">9)</a> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span>
            
            <span id="19v10">(<a href="#19v10">10)</a> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</span>
            
            <span id="19v11">(<a href="#19v11">11)</a> Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power [at all] against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater cringe.</span>
            
            <span id="19v12">(<a href="#19v12">12)</a> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</span>

            <span id="19v13">(<a href="#19v13">13)</a> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span>
            
            <span id="19v14">(<a href="#19v14">14)</a> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</span>

            <span id="19v16">(<a href="#19v16">16)</a> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.</span>
            
            <span id="19v17">(<a href="#19v17">17)</a> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v19">(<a href="#19v19">19)</a> And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
            
            <span id="19v20">(<a href="#19v20">20)</a> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, [and] Greek, [and] Latin.</span>
            
            <span id="19v21">(<a href="#19v21">21)</a> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</span>
            
            <span id="19v22">(<a href="#19v22">22)</a> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v23">(<a href="#19v23">23)</a> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span>
            
            <span id="19v24">(<a href="#19v24">24)</a> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="19v25">(<a href="#19v25">25)</a> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</span>
            
            <span id="19v26">(<a href="#19v26">26)</a> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</span>
            
            <span id="19v27">(<a href="#19v27">27)</a> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home].</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v28">(<a href="#19v28">28)</a> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</span>
            
            <span id="19v29">(<a href="#19v29">29)</a> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="19v30">(<a href="#19v30">30)</a> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="19v31">(<a href="#19v31">31)</a> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</span>
            
            <span id="19v32">(<a href="#19v32">32)</a> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</span>
            
            <span id="19v33">(<a href="#19v33">33)</a> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</span>
            
            <span id="19v34">(<a href="#19v34">34)</a> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</span>
            
            <span id="19v35">(<a href="#19v35">35)</a> And he that saw [it] bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</span>
            
            <span id="19v36">(<a href="#19v36">36)</a> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</span>
            
            <span id="19v37">(<a href="#19v37">37)</a> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v38">(<a href="#19v38">38)</a> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="19v39">(<a href="#19v39">39)</a> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound [weight].</span>
            
            <span id="19v40">(<a href="#19v40">40)</a> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</span>
            
            <span id="19v41">(<a href="#19v41">41)</a> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</span>
            
            <span id="19v42">(<a href="#19v42">42)</a> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation [day]; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</span>

            <span id="20v2">(<a href="#20v2">2)</a> Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</span>
            
            <span id="20v3">(<a href="#20v3">3)</a> Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</span>
            
            <span id="20v4">(<a href="#20v4">4)</a> So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</span>
            
            <span id="20v5">(<a href="#20v5">5)</a> And he stooping down, [and looking in], saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</span>

            <span id="20v8">(<a href="#20v8">8)</a> Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</span>
            
            <span id="20v9">(<a href="#20v9">9)</a> For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</span>

            <span id="20v14">(<a href="#20v14">14)</a> And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="20v15">(<a href="#20v15">15)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</span>
            
            <span id="20v16">(<a href="#20v16">16)</a> Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</span>

            <span id="20v19">(<a href="#20v19">19)</a> Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="20v20">(<a href="#20v20">20)</a> And when he had so said, he shewed unto them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</span>

            <span id="21v4">(<a href="#21v4">4)</a> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="21v5">(<a href="#21v5">5)</a> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</span>
            
            <span id="21v6">(<a href="#21v6">6)</a> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</span>
            
            <span id="21v7">(<a href="#21v7">7)</a> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's coat [unto him], (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</span>
            
            <span id="21v8">(<a href="#21v8">8)</a> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</span>
            
            <span id="21v9">(<a href="#21v9">9)</a> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</span>
            
            <span id="21v10">(<a href="#21v10">10)</a> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span>
            
            <span id="21v11">(<a href="#21v11">11)</a> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</span>
            
            <span id="21v12">(<a href="#21v12">12)</a> Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="21v13">(<a href="#21v13">13)</a> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</span>
            
            <span id="21v14">(<a href="#21v14">14)</a> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="21v15">(<a href="#21v15">15)</a> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</span>
            
            <span id="21v16">(<a href="#21v16">16)</a> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</span>
            
            <span id="21v17">(<a href="#21v17">17)</a> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</span>
            
            <span id="21v18">(<a href="#21v18">18)</a> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thou wouldest not.</span>
            
            <span id="21v19">(<a href="#21v19">19)</a> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</span>
            
            <span id="21v20">(<a href="#21v20">20)</a> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</span>
            
            <span id="21v21">(<a href="#21v21">21)</a> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?</span>
            
            <span id="21v22">(<a href="#21v22">22)</a> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? follow thou me.</span>
            
            <span id="21v23">(<a href="#21v23">23)</a> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?</span>
            
            <span id="21v24">(<a href="#21v24">24)</a> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</span>
            
            <span id="21v25">(<a href="#21v25">25)</a> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</span>
