        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, [departing] from the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little [while], and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And [God] said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Then said [God], Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye [are] not my people, and I will not be your [God].</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people, [there] it shall be said unto them, [Ye are] the sons of the living God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great [shall be] the day of Jezreel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> Plead with your mother, plead: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they [be] the children of whoredoms.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them]: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then [was it] better with me than now.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and [with] the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to [them which were] not my people, Thou [art] my people; and they shall say, [Thou art] my God.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and [for] an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for [another] man: so [will] I also [be] for thee.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and [without] teraphim:</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</span>

            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest.</span>

            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> As they were increased, so they cringed against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame.</span>

            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</span>

            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.</span>

            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span>
            
            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.</span>
