            <h2>2 Corinthians</h2>
            
            <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And our hope of you [is] stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also [are] our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> But [as] God [is] true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> [Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.</span>
                
                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</span>
                
                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</span>
                
                <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</span>
                
                <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</span>
                
                <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</span>
                
                <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> [We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;</span>
                
                <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</span>
                
                <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</span>
                
                <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</span>
                
                <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</span>
                
                <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</span>
                
                <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.</span>
                
                <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</span>
                
                <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.</span>
                
                <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;</span>
                
                <span id="4v18">(<a href="#4v18">18)</a> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.</span>

                <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</span>
                
                <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</span>
                
                <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</span>
                
                <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</span>
                
                <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</span>
                
                <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</span>
                
                <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</span>
                
                <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</span>
                
                <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</span>
                
                <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</span>
                
                <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.</span>
                
                <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</span>
                
                <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</span>
                
                <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.</span>
                
                <span id="5v17">(<a href="#5v17">17)</a> Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</span>
                
                <span id="5v18">(<a href="#5v18">18)</a> And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span>
                
                <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</span>
                
                <span id="5v20">(<a href="#5v20">20)</a> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</span>
                
                <span id="5v21">(<a href="#5v21">21)</a> For he hath made him [to be] cringe for us, who knew no cringe; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</span>

                <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</span>

                <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> I speak not [this] to condemn [you]: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with [you].</span>
                
                <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</span>
                
                <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears.</span>
                
                <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</span>
                
                <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</span>
                
                <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season.</span>
                
                <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</span>
                
                <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</span>
                
                <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, [what] clearing of yourselves, yea, [what] indignation, yea, [what] fear, yea, [what] vehement desire, yea, [what] zeal, yea, [what] revenge! In all [things] ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</span>
                
                <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span>
                
                <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus, is found a truth.</span>
                
                <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</span>

                <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</span>
                
                <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;</span>

                <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</span>
                
                <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.</span>
                
                <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</span>
                
                <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</span>
                
                <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</span>
                
                <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.</span>
                
                <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.</span>
                
                <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</span>
                
                <span id="8v14">(<a href="#8v14">14)</a> But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:</span>
                
                <span id="8v15">(<a href="#8v15">15)</a> As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.</span>

                <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</span>

                <span id="9v5">(<a href="#9v5">5)</a> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] covetousness.</span>
                
                <span id="9v6">(<a href="#9v6">6)</a> But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</span>
                
                <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</span>
                
                <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to every good work:</span>
                
                <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</span>
                
                <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</span>
                
                <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;</span>
                
                <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men];</span>
                
                <span id="9v14">(<a href="#9v14">14)</a> And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</span>
                
                <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.</span>

                <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</span>
                
                <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</span>
                
                <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</span>
                
                <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> (For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</span>
                
                <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</span>
                
                <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</span>
                
                <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ's, even so [are] we Christ's.</span>
                
                <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</span>
                
                <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</span>

                <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present.</span>
                
                <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</span>
                
                <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> But we will not boast of things without [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> For we stretch not ourselves beyond [our measure], as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in [preaching] the gospel of Christ:</span>
                
                <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is], of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</span>

                <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in [my] folly: and indeed bear with me.</span>
                
                <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].</span>
                
                <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</span>

                <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</span>
                
                <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them], to do you service.</span>

                <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</span>

                <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</span>
                
                <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span>
                
                <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</span>
                
                <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</span>
                
                <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> That which I speak, I speak [it] not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</span>
                
                <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span>
                
                <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.</span>

                <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</span>

                <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</span>

                <span id="12v6">(<a href="#12v6">6)</a> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [that] he heareth of me.</span>
                
                <span id="12v7">(<a href="#12v7">7)</a> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</span>
                
                <span id="12v8">(<a href="#12v8">8)</a> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</span>

                <span id="13v1">(<a href="#13v1">1)</a> This [is] the third [time] I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</span>
                
                <span id="13v2">(<a href="#13v2">2)</a> I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have cringed, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</span>
                
                <span id="13v3">(<a href="#13v3">3)</a> Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</span>
                
                <span id="13v4">(<a href="#13v4">4)</a> For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</span>
                
                <span id="13v5">(<a href="#13v5">5)</a> Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</span>
                
                <span id="13v6">(<a href="#13v6">6)</a> But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</span>
                
                <span id="13v7">(<a href="#13v7">7)</a> Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</span>
                
                <span id="13v8">(<a href="#13v8">8)</a> For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="13v9">(<a href="#13v9">9)</a> For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection.</span>
                
                <span id="13v10">(<a href="#13v10">10)</a> Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</span>
                
                <span id="13v11">(<a href="#13v11">11)</a> Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</span>
                
                <span id="13v12">(<a href="#13v12">12)</a> Greet one another with an holy kiss.</span>
                
                <span id="13v13">(<a href="#13v13">13)</a> All the saints salute you.</span>
                
                <span id="13v14">(<a href="#13v14">14)</a> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [be] with you all. Amen.</span>
