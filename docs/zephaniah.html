                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> I will utterly consume all [things] from off the land, saith the LORD.</span>

                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [and] the name of the Chemarims with the priests;</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship [and] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And them that are turned back from the LORD; and [those] that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.</span>

                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</span>

                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</span>

                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit [them]; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> The great day of the LORD [is] near, [it is] near, and hasteth greatly, [even] the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> That day [is] a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have cringed against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</span>

                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</span>

                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings.</span>

                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of it [was] a burden.</span>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</span>
