                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now these [are] the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt [already].</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we:</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of the land.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, [was] with rigour.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptian women; for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child], she hid him three months.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And when she had opened [it], she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the Hebrews' children.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water], and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How [is it that] ye are come so soon to day?</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And she bare [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto [them].</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, [even] to Horeb.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I.</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground.</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And Moses said unto God, Who [am] I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this [shall be] a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And Moses said unto God, Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? what shall I say unto them?</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this [is] my name for ever, and this [is] my memorial unto all generations.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt:</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</span>
                
                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</span>
