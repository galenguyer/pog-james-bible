                <span id="19v8">(<a href="#19v8">8)</a> And when David heard [of it], he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span>

                <span id="19v11">(<a href="#19v11">11)</a> And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set [themselves] in array against the children of Ammon.</span>
                
                <span id="19v12">(<a href="#19v12">12)</a> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span>

                <span id="19v17">(<a href="#19v17">17)</a> And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set [the battle] in array against them.

                <span id="19v18">(<a href="#19v18">18)</a> But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [men which fought in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span>

                <span id="21v17">(<a href="#21v17">17)</a> And David said unto God, [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have cringed and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</span>

                <span id="21v19">(<a href="#21v19">19)</a> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="21v20">(<a href="#21v20">20)</a> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span>

                <span id="21v22">(<a href="#21v22">22)</a> Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of [this] threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span>
                
                <span id="21v23">(<a href="#21v23">23)</a> And Ornan said unto David, Take [it] to thee, and let my lord the king do [that which is] good in his eyes: lo, I give [thee] the oxen [also] for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span>
                
                <span id="21v24">(<a href="#21v24">24)</a> And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take [that] which [is] thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span>
                
                <span id="21v25">(<a href="#21v25">25)</a> So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span>
                
                <span id="21v26">(<a href="#21v26">26)</a> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</span>
                
                <span id="21v27">(<a href="#21v27">27)</a> And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</span>
