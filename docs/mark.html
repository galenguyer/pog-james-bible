        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</span>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v37">(<a href="#1v37">37)</a> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v38">(<a href="#1v38">38)</a> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</span>
            
            <span id="1v39">(<a href="#1v39">39)</a> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</span>
            
            <span id="1v40">(<a href="#1v40">40)</a> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span>
            
            <span id="1v41">(<a href="#1v41">41)</a> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</span>
            
            <span id="1v42">(<a href="#1v42">42)</a> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v43">(<a href="#1v43">43)</a> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</span>
            
            <span id="1v44">(<a href="#1v44">44)</a> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v45">(<a href="#1v45">45)</a> But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And again he entered into Capernaum after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy cringes be forgiven thee.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Why doth this [man] thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive cringes but God only?</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, [Thy] cringes be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive cringes, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and cringers sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and cringers, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and cringers?</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> When Jesus heard [it], he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but cringers to repentance.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</span>
            
            <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</span>
            
            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</span>
            
            <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</span>
            
            <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</span>
            
            <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth [unto him] whom he would: and they came unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And Simon he surnamed Peter;</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> And he called them [unto him], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</span>

            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.</span>

            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</span>

            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</span>
            
            <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> And they that saw [it] told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and [also] concerning the swine.</span>

            <span id="5v24">(<a href="#5v24">24)</a> And [Jesus] went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</span>

            <span id="5v27">(<a href="#5v27">27)</a> When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</span>
            
            <span id="5v28">(<a href="#5v28">28)</a> For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</span>

            <span id="5v30">(<a href="#5v30">30)</a> And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</span>
            
            <span id="5v31">(<a href="#5v31">31)</a> And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span>

            <span id="5v38">(<a href="#5v38">38)</a> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</span>
            
            <span id="5v39">(<a href="#5v39">39)</a> And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>
            
            <span id="5v40">(<a href="#5v40">40)</a> And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</span>
            
            <span id="5v41">(<a href="#5v41">41)</a> And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</span>
            
            <span id="5v42">(<a href="#5v42">42)</a> And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span>
            
            <span id="5v43">(<a href="#5v43">43)</a> And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span>

            <span id="6v6">(<a href="#6v6">6)</a> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v7">(<a href="#6v7">7)</a> And he called [unto him] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</span>
            
            <span id="6v8">(<a href="#6v8">8)</a> And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in [their] purse:</span>
            
            <span id="6v9">(<a href="#6v9">9)</a> But [be] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</span>
            
            <span id="6v10">(<a href="#6v10">10)</a> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</span>
            
            <span id="6v11">(<a href="#6v11">11)</a> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span>
            
            <span id="6v12">(<a href="#6v12">12)</a> And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</span>
            
            <span id="6v13">(<a href="#6v13">13)</a> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed [them].</span>
            
            <span id="6v14">(<a href="#6v14">14)</a> And king Herod heard [of him]; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v15">(<a href="#6v15">15)</a> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</span>
            
            <span id="6v16">(<a href="#6v16">16)</a> But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</span>
            
            <span id="6v17">(<a href="#6v17">17)</a> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</span>
            
            <span id="6v18">(<a href="#6v18">18)</a> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</span>
            
            <span id="6v19">(<a href="#6v19">19)</a> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</span>
            
            <span id="6v20">(<a href="#6v20">20)</a> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</span>
            
            <span id="6v21">(<a href="#6v21">21)</a> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galilee;</span>
            
            <span id="6v22">(<a href="#6v22">22)</a> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee.</span>
            
            <span id="6v23">(<a href="#6v23">23)</a> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</span>
            
            <span id="6v24">(<a href="#6v24">24)</a> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span>
            
            <span id="6v25">(<a href="#6v25">25)</a> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</span>
            
            <span id="6v26">(<a href="#6v26">26)</a> And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</span>
            
            <span id="6v27">(<a href="#6v27">27)</a> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span>
            
            <span id="6v28">(<a href="#6v28">28)</a> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</span>
            
            <span id="6v29">(<a href="#6v29">29)</a> And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</span>
            
            <span id="6v30">(<a href="#6v30">30)</a> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</span>
            
            <span id="6v31">(<a href="#6v31">31)</a> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span>
            
            <span id="6v32">(<a href="#6v32">32)</a> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</span>
            
            <span id="6v33">(<a href="#6v33">33)</a> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v34">(<a href="#6v34">34)</a> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</span>
            
            <span id="6v35">(<a href="#6v35">35)</a> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed:</span>
            
            <span id="6v36">(<a href="#6v36">36)</a> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</span>
            
            <span id="6v37">(<a href="#6v37">37)</a> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</span>
            
            <span id="6v38">(<a href="#6v38">38)</a> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</span>
            
            <span id="6v39">(<a href="#6v39">39)</a> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</span>
            
            <span id="6v40">(<a href="#6v40">40)</a> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</span>
            
            <span id="6v41">(<a href="#6v41">41)</a> And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</span>
            
            <span id="6v42">(<a href="#6v42">42)</a> And they did all eat, and were filled.</span>
            
            <span id="6v43">(<a href="#6v43">43)</a> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</span>
            
            <span id="6v44">(<a href="#6v44">44)</a> And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</span>
            
            <span id="6v45">(<a href="#6v45">45)</a> And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</span>
            
            <span id="6v46">(<a href="#6v46">46)</a> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</span>
            
            <span id="6v47">(<a href="#6v47">47)</a> And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span>
            
            <span id="6v48">(<a href="#6v48">48)</a> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</span>
            
            <span id="6v49">(<a href="#6v49">49)</a> But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</span>
            
            <span id="6v50">(<a href="#6v50">50)</a> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="6v51">(<a href="#6v51">51)</a> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</span>
            
            <span id="6v52">(<a href="#6v52">52)</a> For they considered not [the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</span>
            
            <span id="6v53">(<a href="#6v53">53)</a> And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</span>
            
            <span id="6v54">(<a href="#6v54">54)</a> And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</span>
            
            <span id="6v55">(<a href="#6v55">55)</a> And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</span>
            
            <span id="6v56">(<a href="#6v56">56)</a> And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="7v2">(<a href="#7v2">2)</a> And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</span>
            
            <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</span>
            
            <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</span>
            
            <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</span>
            
            <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.</span>
            
            <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</span>
            
            <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</span>
            
            <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span>
            
            <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</span>

            <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</span>

            <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:</span>
            
            <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</span>

            <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</span>

            <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</span>

            <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</span>

            <span id="7v27">(<a href="#7v27">27)</a> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.</span>
            
            <span id="7v28">(<a href="#7v28">28)</a> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span>
            
            <span id="7v29">(<a href="#7v29">29)</a> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span>

            <span id="7v34">(<a href="#7v34">34)</a> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span>
            
            <span id="7v35">(<a href="#7v35">35)</a> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</span>
            
            <span id="7v36">(<a href="#7v36">36)</a> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];</span>
            
            <span id="7v37">(<a href="#7v37">37)</a> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</span>

            <span id="10v25">(<a href="#10v25">25)</a> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>

            <span id="10v39">(<a href="#10v39">39)</a> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</span>
            
            <span id="10v40">(<a href="#10v40">40)</a> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared.</span>
            
            <span id="10v41">(<a href="#10v41">41)</a> And when the ten heard [it], they began to be much displeased with James and John.</span>

            <span id="10v47">(<a href="#10v47">47)</a> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
            
            <span id="10v48">(<a href="#10v48">48)</a> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
            
            <span id="10v49">(<a href="#10v49">49)</a> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</span>
            
            <span id="10v50">(<a href="#10v50">50)</a> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</span>

            <span id="12v19">(<a href="#12v19">19)</a> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span>
            
            <span id="12v20">(<a href="#12v20">20)</a> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</span>
            
            <span id="12v21">(<a href="#12v21">21)</a> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</span>
            
            <span id="12v22">(<a href="#12v22">22)</a> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</span>
            
            <span id="12v23">(<a href="#12v23">23)</a> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="12v24">(<a href="#12v24">24)</a> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</span>
            
            <span id="12v25">(<a href="#12v25">25)</a> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="12v26">(<a href="#12v26">26)</a> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span>
            
            <span id="12v27">(<a href="#12v27">27)</a> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</span>

            <span id="12v28">(<a href="#12v28">28)</a> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</span>
            
            <span id="12v29">(<a href="#12v29">29)</a> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</span>
            
            <span id="12v30">(<a href="#12v30">30)</a> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.</span>
            
            <span id="12v31">(<a href="#12v31">31)</a> And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</span>
            
            <span id="12v32">(<a href="#12v32">32)</a> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</span>
            
            <span id="12v33">(<a href="#12v33">33)</a> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span>
            
            <span id="12v34">(<a href="#12v34">34)</a> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].</span>

            <span id="12v36">(<a href="#12v36">36)</a> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span>

            <span id="12v41">(<a href="#12v41">41)</a> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</span>
            
            <span id="12v42">(<a href="#12v42">42)</a> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</span>

            <span id="12v44">(<a href="#12v44">44)</a> For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.</span>

            <span id="14v28">(<a href="#14v28">28)</a> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="14v29">(<a href="#14v29">29)</a> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I.</span>
            
            <span id="14v30">(<a href="#14v30">30)</a> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, [even] in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
            
            <span id="14v31">(<a href="#14v31">31)</a> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</span>
            
            <span id="14v32">(<a href="#14v32">32)</a> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</span>
            
            <span id="14v33">(<a href="#14v33">33)</a> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</span>
            
            <span id="14v34">(<a href="#14v34">34)</a> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</span>
            
            <span id="14v35">(<a href="#14v35">35)</a> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</span>
            
            <span id="14v36">(<a href="#14v36">36)</a> And he said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</span>
            
            <span id="14v37">(<a href="#14v37">37)</a> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</span>
            
            <span id="14v38">(<a href="#14v38">38)</a> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak.</span>
            
            <span id="14v39">(<a href="#14v39">39)</a> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</span>
            
            <span id="14v40">(<a href="#14v40">40)</a> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</span>
            
            <span id="14v41">(<a href="#14v41">41)</a> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of cringers.</span>
            
            <span id="14v42">(<a href="#14v42">42)</a> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</span>

            <span id="14v43">(<a href="#14v43">43)</a> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span>
            
            <span id="14v44">(<a href="#14v44">44)</a> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely.</span>
            
            <span id="14v45">(<a href="#14v45">45)</a> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v46">(<a href="#14v46">46)</a> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</span>
            
            <span id="14v47">(<a href="#14v47">47)</a> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span>
            
            <span id="14v48">(<a href="#14v48">48)</a> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with] staves to take me?</span>
            
            <span id="14v49">(<a href="#14v49">49)</a> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</span>
            
            <span id="14v50">(<a href="#14v50">50)</a> And they all forsook him, and fled.</span>
            
            <span id="14v51">(<a href="#14v51">51)</a> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body]; and the young men laid hold on him:</span>
            
            <span id="14v52">(<a href="#14v52">52)</a> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v53">(<a href="#14v53">53)</a> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</span>
            
            <span id="14v54">(<a href="#14v54">54)</a> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</span>
            
            <span id="14v55">(<a href="#14v55">55)</a> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</span>
            
            <span id="14v56">(<a href="#14v56">56)</a> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</span>
            
            <span id="14v57">(<a href="#14v57">57)</a> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="14v58">(<a href="#14v58">58)</a> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</span>
            
            <span id="14v59">(<a href="#14v59">59)</a> But neither so did their witness agree together.</span>
            
            <span id="14v60">(<a href="#14v60">60)</a> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] these witness against thee?</span>
            
            <span id="14v61">(<a href="#14v61">61)</a> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</span>
            
            <span id="14v62">(<a href="#14v62">62)</a> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="14v63">(<a href="#14v63">63)</a> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</span>
            
            <span id="14v64">(<a href="#14v64">64)</a> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</span>
            
            <span id="14v65">(<a href="#14v65">65)</a> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v66">(<a href="#14v66">66)</a> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</span>
            
            <span id="14v67">(<a href="#14v67">67)</a> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</span>
            
            <span id="14v68">(<a href="#14v68">68)</a> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</span>
            
            <span id="14v69">(<a href="#14v69">69)</a> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them.</span>
            
            <span id="14v70">(<a href="#14v70">70)</a> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth [thereto].</span>
            
            <span id="14v71">(<a href="#14v71">71)</a> But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not this man of whom ye speak.</span>
            
            <span id="14v72">(<a href="#14v72">72)</a> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</span>

            <span id="15v1">(<a href="#15v1">1)</a> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.</span>
            
            <span id="15v2">(<a href="#15v2">2)</a> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest [it].</span>
            
            <span id="15v3">(<a href="#15v3">3)</a> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="15v4">(<a href="#15v4">4)</a> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</span>
            
            <span id="15v5">(<a href="#15v5">5)</a> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</span>
            
            <span id="15v6">(<a href="#15v6">6)</a> Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</span>
            
            <span id="15v7">(<a href="#15v7">7)</a> And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span>

            <span id="15v9">(<a href="#15v9">9)</a> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span>
            
            <span id="15v10">(<a href="#15v10">10)</a> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</span>
            
            <span id="15v11">(<a href="#15v11">11)</a> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="15v12">(<a href="#15v12">12)</a> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span>
            
            <span id="15v13">(<a href="#15v13">13)</a> And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span>
            
            <span id="15v14">(<a href="#15v14">14)</a> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="15v15">(<a href="#15v15">15)</a> And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.</span>
            
            <span id="15v16">(<a href="#15v16">16)</a> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</span>
            
            <span id="15v17">(<a href="#15v17">17)</a> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],</span>
            
            <span id="15v18">(<a href="#15v18">18)</a> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span>
            
            <span id="15v19">(<a href="#15v19">19)</a> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.</span>
            
            <span id="15v20">(<a href="#15v20">20)</a> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</span>
            
            <span id="15v21">(<a href="#15v21">21)</a> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</span>

            <span id="15v23">(<a href="#15v23">23)</a> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.</span>
            
            <span id="15v24">(<a href="#15v24">24)</a> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</span>
            
            <span id="15v25">(<a href="#15v25">25)</a> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span>
            
            <span id="15v26">(<a href="#15v26">26)</a> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>

            <span id="15v28">(<a href="#15v28">28)</a> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span>
            
            <span id="15v29">(<a href="#15v29">29)</a> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,</span>
            
            <span id="15v30">(<a href="#15v30">30)</a> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span>
            
            <span id="15v31">(<a href="#15v31">31)</a> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span>

            <span id="15v35">(<a href="#15v35">35)</a> And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</span>
            
            <span id="15v36">(<a href="#15v36">36)</a> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</span>
            
            <span id="15v37">(<a href="#15v37">37)</a> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="15v38">(<a href="#15v38">38)</a> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span>

            <span id="15v39">(<a href="#15v39">39)</a> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="15v40">(<a href="#15v40">40)</a> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span>

            <span id="15v44">(<a href="#15v44">44)</a> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</span>

            <span id="16v5">(<a href="#16v5">5)</a> And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</span>
            
            <span id="16v6">(<a href="#16v6">6)</a> And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</span>
            
            <span id="16v7">(<a href="#16v7">7)</a> But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="16v8">(<a href="#16v8">8)</a> And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="16v9">(<a href="#16v9">9)</a> Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</span>
            
            <span id="16v10">(<a href="#16v10">10)</a> [And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span>
            
            <span id="16v11">(<a href="#16v11">11)</a> And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="16v12">(<a href="#16v12">12)</a> After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</span>
            
            <span id="16v13">(<a href="#16v13">13)</a> And they went and told [it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="16v14">(<a href="#16v14">14)</a> Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</span>
            
            <span id="16v15">(<a href="#16v15">15)</a> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</span>
            
            <span id="16v16">(<a href="#16v16">16)</a> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</span>
            
            <span id="16v17">(<a href="#16v17">17)</a> And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</span>
            
            <span id="16v18">(<a href="#16v18">18)</a> They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="16v19">(<a href="#16v19">19)</a> So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</span>
            
            <span id="16v20">(<a href="#16v20">20)</a> And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</span>
