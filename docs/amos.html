            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver [them] up to Edom:</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</span>

            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, [and] with the sound of the trumpet:</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the [same] maid, to profane my holy name:</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And they lay [themselves] down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned [in] the house of their god.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height [was] like the height of the cedars, and he [was] strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. [Is it] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed [that is] full of sheaves.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and [he that is] swift of foot shall not deliver [himself]: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And [he that is] courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</span>

            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin [is] for him? shall [one] take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done [it]?</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary [there shall be] even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus [in] a couch.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</span>

            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</span>

            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every [cow at that which is] before her; and ye shall cast [them] into the palace, saith the LORD.</span>

            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> Come to Beth-el, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes after three years:</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim [and] publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> And also I have withholden the rain from you, when [there were] yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> So two [or] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured [them]: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> I have overthrown [some] of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: [and] because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</span>

            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour [it], and [there be] none to quench [it] in Beth-el.</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> [Seek him] that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD [is] his name:</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</span>

            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty cringes: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate [from their right].</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it [is] an evil time.</span>

            <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span>

            <span id="5v24">(<a href="#5v24">24)</a> But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span>
