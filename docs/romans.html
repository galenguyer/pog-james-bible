            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</span>
                
                <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</span>
                
                <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</span>
                
                <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</span>
                
                <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</span>
                
                <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span>
                
                <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span>
                
                <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</span>
                
                <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For there is no respect of persons with God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> For as many as have cringed without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have cringed in the law shall be judged by the law;</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</span>
                
                <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</span>
                
                <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</span>
                
                <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a cringer?</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under cringe;</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And the way of peace have they not known:</span>

                <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</span>

                <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span>
                
                <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</span>

                <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</span>
                
                <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</span>

                <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</span>
                
                <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</span>
                
                <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet cringers, Christ died for us.</span>
                
                <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</span>
                
                <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</span>
                
                <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</span>
                
                <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> Wherefore, as by one man cringe entered into the world, and death by cringe; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have cringed:</span>
                
                <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> (For until the law cringe was in the world: but cringe is not imputed when there is no law.</span>
                
                <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not cringed after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</span>
                
                <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</span>
                
                <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> And not as [it was] by one that cringed, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.</span>
                
                <span id="5v17">(<a href="#5v17">17)</a> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</span>
                
                <span id="5v18">(<a href="#5v18">18)</a> Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.</span>
                
                <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> For as by one man's disobedience many were made cringers, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span>

                <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> But cringe, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law cringe [was] dead.</span>
                
                <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, cringe revived, and I died.</span>
                
                <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.</span>
                
                <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> For cringe, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].</span>
                
                <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span>
                
                <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But cringe, that it might appear cringe, working death in me by that which is good; that cringe by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span>
                
                <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under cringe.</span>
                
                <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</span>
                
                <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.</span>
                
                <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> Now then it is no more I that do it, but cringe that dwelleth in me.</span>
                
                <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good I find not.</span>
                
                <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span>
                
                <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but cringe that dwelleth in me.</span>
                
                <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</span>
                
                <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</span>
                
                <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of cringe which is in my members.</span>
                
                <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span>
                
                <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of cringe.</span>

                <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of cringe and death.</span>
                
                <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for cringe, condemned cringe in the flesh:</span>
                
                <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled among us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.</span>
                
                <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</span>
                
                <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</span>
                
                <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</span>
                
                <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of cringe; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.</span>
                
                <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</span>
                
                <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</span>
                
                <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</span>
                
                <span id="8v14">(<a href="#8v14">14)</a> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</span>
                
                <span id="8v15">(<a href="#8v15">15)</a> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span>
                
                <span id="8v16">(<a href="#8v16">16)</a> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</span>
                
                <span id="8v17">(<a href="#8v17">17)</a> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified together.</span>
                
                <span id="8v18">(<a href="#8v18">18)</a> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed among us.</span>
                
                <span id="8v19">(<a href="#8v19">19)</a> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</span>
                
                <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope,</span>
                
                <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span>
                
                <span id="8v22">(<a href="#8v22">22)</a> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</span>
                
                <span id="8v23">(<a href="#8v23">23)</a> And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.</span>
                
                <span id="8v24">(<a href="#8v24">24)</a> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</span>
                
                <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> But if we hope for that we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for [it].</span>
                
                <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span>
                
                <span id="8v27">(<a href="#8v27">27)</a> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</span>
                
                <span id="8v28">(<a href="#8v28">28)</a> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.</span>
                
                <span id="8v29">(<a href="#8v29">29)</a> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</span>
                
                <span id="8v30">(<a href="#8v30">30)</a> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</span>
                
                <span id="8v31">(<a href="#8v31">31)</a> What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?</span>
                
                <span id="8v32">(<a href="#8v32">32)</a> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</span>
                
                <span id="8v33">(<a href="#8v33">33)</a> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? [It is] God that justifieth.</span>
                
                <span id="8v34">(<a href="#8v34">34)</a> Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</span>
                
                <span id="8v35">(<a href="#8v35">35)</a> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span>
                
                <span id="8v36">(<a href="#8v36">36)</a> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span>
                
                <span id="8v37">(<a href="#8v37">37)</a> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</span>
                
                <span id="8v38">(<a href="#8v38">38)</a> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</span>
                
                <span id="8v39">(<a href="#8v39">39)</a> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

                <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</span>
                
                <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</span>
                
                <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</span>
                
                <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</span>
                
                <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</span>
                
                <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above]:)</span>
                
                <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</span>
                
                <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</span>
                
                <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</span>
                
                <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span>
                
                <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span>
                
                <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</span>
                
                <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span>
                
                <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</span>
                
                <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</span>
                
                <span id="10v16">(<a href="#10v16">16)</a> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</span>
                
                <span id="10v17">(<a href="#10v17">17)</a> So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span>
                
                <span id="10v18">(<a href="#10v18">18)</a> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</span>
                
                <span id="10v19">(<a href="#10v19">19)</a> But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation I will anger you.</span>
                
                <span id="10v20">(<a href="#10v20">20)</a> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</span>
                
                <span id="10v21">(<a href="#10v21">21)</a> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</span>

                <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe of Benjamin.</span>
                
                <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span>
                
                <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.</span>
                
                <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span>
                
                <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</span>
                
                <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</span>
                
                <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</span>
                
                <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</span>
                
                <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</span>
                
                <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span>
                
                <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span>
                
                <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</span>
                
                <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> If by any means I may provoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them.</span>
                
                <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?</span>
                
                <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches.</span>
                
                <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</span>
                
                <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span>
                
                <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</span>
                
                <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span>
                
                <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.</span>
                
                <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span>
                
                <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</span>
                
                <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches], be graffed into their own olive tree?</span>
                
                <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</span>
                
                <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span>
                
                <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their cringes.</span>
                
                <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.</span>
                
                <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.</span>
                
                <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</span>
                
                <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</span>
                
                <span id="11v32">(<a href="#11v32">32)</a> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</span>
                
                <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</span>
                
                <span id="11v34">(<a href="#11v34">34)</a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span>
                
                <span id="11v35">(<a href="#11v35">35)</a> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span>

                <span id="15v24">(<a href="#15v24">24)</a> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your [company].</span>
                
                <span id="15v25">(<a href="#15v25">25)</a> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</span>

                <span id="15v28">(<a href="#15v28">28)</a> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</span>

                <span id="15v31">(<a href="#15v31">31)</a> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;</span>
