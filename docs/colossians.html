            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus [our] brother,</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints,</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as [it doth] also in you, since the day ye heard [of it], and knew the grace of God in truth:</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son:</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of cringes:</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell;</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> [Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> To whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the cringes of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And you, being dead in your cringes and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> (Touch not; taste not; handle not;</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</span>

            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</span>

            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</span>
