        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> These [be] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red [sea], between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> ([There are] eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all [the places] nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye [are], and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken [is] good [for us] to do.</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between [every] man and his brother, and the stranger [that is] with him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up [and] possess [it], as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</span>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</span>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents [in], in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="1v37">(<a href="#1v37">37)</a> Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</span>
            
            <span id="1v38">(<a href="#1v38">38)</a> [But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v39">(<a href="#1v39">39)</a> Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v40">(<a href="#1v40">40)</a> But [as for] you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span>
            
            <span id="1v41">(<a href="#1v41">41)</a> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have cringed against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</span>
            
            <span id="1v42">(<a href="#1v42">42)</a> And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</span>
            
            <span id="1v43">(<a href="#1v43">43)</a> So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</span>
            
            <span id="1v44">(<a href="#1v44">44)</a> And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] unto Hormah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v45">(<a href="#1v45">45)</a> And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="1v46">(<a href="#1v46">46)</a> So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode [there].</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau [for] a possession.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot [for] a possession.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Now rise up, [said I], and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And [when] thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon [any] possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot [for] a possession.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, [even] unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle.</span>
            
            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</span>
            
            <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</span>
            
            <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</span>
            
            <span id="2v30">(<a href="#2v30">30)</a> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day.</span>
            
            <span id="2v31">(<a href="#2v31">31)</a> And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</span>
            
            <span id="2v32">(<a href="#2v32">32)</a> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</span>
            
            <span id="2v33">(<a href="#2v33">33)</a> And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</span>
            
            <span id="2v34">(<a href="#2v34">34)</a> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</span>
            
            <span id="2v35">(<a href="#2v35">35)</a> Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</span>
            
            <span id="2v36">(<a href="#2v36">36)</a> From Aroer, which [is] by the brink of the river of Arnon, and [from] the city that [is] by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</span>
            
            <span id="2v37">(<a href="#2v37">37)</a> Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, [nor] unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</span>

            <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</span>
            
            <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</span>
            
            <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span>
            
            <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, [that] the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant.</span>
            
            <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted [themselves]; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span>
            
            <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked people:</span>
            
            <span id="9v14">(<a href="#9v14">14)</a> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</span>
            
            <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant [were] in my two hands.</span>
            
            <span id="9v16">(<a href="#9v16">16)</a> And I looked, and, behold, ye had cringed against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</span>
            
            <span id="9v17">(<a href="#9v17">17)</a> And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</span>
            
            <span id="9v18">(<a href="#9v18">18)</a> And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your cringes which ye cringed, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span>
            
            <span id="9v19">(<a href="#9v19">19)</a> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</span>
            
            <span id="9v20">(<a href="#9v20">20)</a> And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</span>
            
            <span id="9v21">(<a href="#9v21">21)</a> And I took your cringe, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span>
            
            <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</span>
            
            <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</span>
            
            <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</span>
            
            <span id="9v25">(<a href="#9v25">25)</a> Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first]; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span>
            
            <span id="9v26">(<a href="#9v26">26)</a> I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span>
            
            <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their cringe:</span>
            
            <span id="9v28">(<a href="#9v28">28)</a> Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</span>
            
            <span id="9v29">(<a href="#9v29">29)</a> Yet they [are] thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</span>

            <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.</span>
