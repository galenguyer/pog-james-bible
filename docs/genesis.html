                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</span>

                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</span>

                <span id="20v6">(<a href="#20v6">6)</a> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</span>

                <span id="30v16">(<a href="#30v16">16)</a> And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span>

                <span id="30v41">(<a href="#30v41">41)</a> And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</span>

                <span id="31v2">(<a href="#31v2">2)</a> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it [was] not toward him as before.</span>

                <span id="31v9">(<a href="#31v9">9)</a> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given [them] to me.</span>

                <span id="31v17">(<a href="#31v17">17)</a> Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</span>

                <span id="31v19">(<a href="#31v19">19)</a> And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that [were] her father's.</span>

                <span id="31v25">(<a href="#31v25">25)</a> Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</span>
                
                <span id="31v26">(<a href="#31v26">26)</a> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives [taken] with the sword?</span>
                
                <span id="31v27">(<a href="#31v27">27)</a> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</span>
                
                <span id="31v28">(<a href="#31v28">28)</a> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in [so] doing.</span>

                <span id="31v30">(<a href="#31v30">30)</a> And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</span>
                
                <span id="31v31">(<a href="#31v31">31)</a> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</span>
                
                <span id="31v32">(<a href="#31v32">32)</a> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what [is] thine with me, and take [it] to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</span>
                
                <span id="31v33">(<a href="#31v33">33)</a> And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found [them] not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</span>
                
                <span id="31v34">(<a href="#31v34">34)</a> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found [them] not.</span>
                
                <span id="31v35">(<a href="#31v35">35)</a> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women [is] upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.</span>

                <span id="31v36">(<a href="#31v36">36)</a> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? what [is] my cringe, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</span>
                
                <span id="31v37">(<a href="#31v37">37)</a> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</span>
                
                <span id="31v38">(<a href="#31v38">38)</a> This twenty years [have] I [been] with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</span>
                
                <span id="31v39">(<a href="#31v39">39)</a> That which was torn [of beasts] I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night.</span>
                
                <span id="31v40">(<a href="#31v40">40)</a> [Thus] I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</span>

                <span id="37v23">(<a href="#37v23">23)</a> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, [his] coat of [many] colours that [was] on him;</span>
                
                <span id="37v24">(<a href="#37v24">24)</a> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty, [there was] no water in it.</span>
                
                <span id="37v25">(<a href="#37v25">25)</a> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry [it] down to Egypt.</span>
                
                <span id="37v26">(<a href="#37v26">26)</a> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit [is it] if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</span>
                
                <span id="37v27">(<a href="#37v27">27)</a> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he [is] our brother [and] our flesh. And his brethren were content.</span>
                
                <span id="37v28">(<a href="#37v28">28)</a> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</span>

                <span id="37v29">(<a href="#37v29">29)</a> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</span>
                
                <span id="37v30">(<a href="#37v30">30)</a> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child [is] not; and I, whither shall I go?</span>
                
                <span id="37v31">(<a href="#37v31">31)</a> And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</span>
                
                <span id="37v32">(<a href="#37v32">32)</a> And they sent the coat of [many] colours, and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it [be] thy son's coat or no.</span>
                
                <span id="37v33">(<a href="#37v33">33)</a> And he knew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</span>
                
                <span id="37v34">(<a href="#37v34">34)</a> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span>

                <span id="37v36">(<a href="#37v36">36)</a> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.</span>

                <span id="38v10">(<a href="#38v10">10)</a> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</span>

                <span id="38v22">(<a href="#38v22">22)</a> And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this [place].</span>

                <span id="39v1">(<a href="#39v1">1)</a> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</span>
                
                <span id="39v2">(<a href="#39v2">2)</a> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span>
                
                <span id="39v3">(<a href="#39v3">3)</a> And his master saw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</span>
                
                <span id="39v4">(<a href="#39v4">4)</a> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand.</span>
                
                <span id="39v5">(<a href="#39v5">5)</a> And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</span>
                
                <span id="39v6">(<a href="#39v6">6)</a> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was [a] goodly [person], and well favoured.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="39v7">(<a href="#39v7">7)</a> And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</span>
                
                <span id="39v8">(<a href="#39v8">8)</a> But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</span>
                
                <span id="39v9">(<a href="#39v9">9)</a> [There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and cringe against God?</span>
                
                <span id="39v10">(<a href="#39v10">10)</a> And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.</span>
                
                <span id="39v11">(<a href="#39v11">11)</a> And it came to pass about this time, that [Joseph] went into the house to do his business; and [there was] none of the men of the house there within.</span>
                
                <span id="39v12">(<a href="#39v12">12)</a> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</span>
                
                <span id="39v13">(<a href="#39v13">13)</a> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</span>
                
                <span id="39v14">(<a href="#39v14">14)</a> That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</span>
                
                <span id="39v15">(<a href="#39v15">15)</a> And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</span>
                
                <span id="39v16">(<a href="#39v16">16)</a> And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</span>
                
                <span id="39v17">(<a href="#39v17">17)</a> And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</span>
                
                <span id="39v18">(<a href="#39v18">18)</a> And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</span>
                
                <span id="39v19">(<a href="#39v19">19)</a> And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</span>
                
                <span id="39v20">(<a href="#39v20">20)</a> And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="39v21">(<a href="#39v21">21)</a> But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span>
                
                <span id="39v22">(<a href="#39v22">22)</a> And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it].</span>
                
                <span id="39v23">(<a href="#39v23">23)</a> The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [that was] under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and [that] which he did, the LORD made [it] to prosper.</span>

                <span id="40v1">(<a href="#40v1">1)</a> And it came to pass after these things, [that] the butler of the king of Egypt and [his] baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.</span>
                
                <span id="40v2">(<a href="#40v2">2)</a> And Pharaoh was wroth against two [of] his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</span>
                
                <span id="40v3">(<a href="#40v3">3)</a> And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph [was] bound.</span>
                
                <span id="40v4">(<a href="#40v4">4)</a> And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="40v5">(<a href="#40v5">5)</a> And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which [were] bound in the prison.</span>
                
                <span id="40v6">(<a href="#40v6">6)</a> And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they [were] sad.</span>
                
                <span id="40v7">(<a href="#40v7">7)</a> And he asked Pharaoh's officers that [were] with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye [so] sadly to day?</span>
                
                <span id="40v8">(<a href="#40v8">8)</a> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me [them], I pray you.</span>
                
                <span id="40v9">(<a href="#40v9">9)</a> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me;</span>
                
                <span id="40v10">(<a href="#40v10">10)</a> And in the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as though it budded, [and] her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</span>
                
                <span id="40v11">(<a href="#40v11">11)</a> And Pharaoh's cup [was] in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.</span>
                
                <span id="40v12">(<a href="#40v12">12)</a> And Joseph said unto him, This [is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days:</span>
                
                <span id="40v13">(<a href="#40v13">13)</a> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</span>
                
                <span id="40v14">(<a href="#40v14">14)</a> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</span>
                
                <span id="40v15">(<a href="#40v15">15)</a> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</span>
                
                <span id="40v16">(<a href="#40v16">16)</a> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three white baskets on my head:</span>
                
                <span id="40v17">(<a href="#40v17">17)</a> And in the uppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</span>
                
                <span id="40v18">(<a href="#40v18">18)</a> And Joseph answered and said, This [is] the interpretation thereof: The three baskets [are] three days:</span>
                
                <span id="40v19">(<a href="#40v19">19)</a> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="40v20">(<a href="#40v20">20)</a> And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</span>
                
                <span id="40v21">(<a href="#40v21">21)</a> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:</span>
                
                <span id="40v22">(<a href="#40v22">22)</a> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</span>
                
                <span id="40v23">(<a href="#40v23">23)</a> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="41"><a href="#41">Chapter 41</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="41v1">(<a href="#41v1">1)</a> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</span>
                
                <span id="41v2">(<a href="#41v2">2)</a> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</span>
                
                <span id="41v3">(<a href="#41v3">3)</a> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river.</span>
                
                <span id="41v4">(<a href="#41v4">4)</a> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</span>
                
                <span id="41v5">(<a href="#41v5">5)</a> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</span>
                
                <span id="41v6">(<a href="#41v6">6)</a> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</span>
                
                <span id="41v7">(<a href="#41v7">7)</a> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.</span>
                
                <span id="41v8">(<a href="#41v8">8)</a> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="41v9">(<a href="#41v9">9)</a> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</span>
                
                <span id="41v10">(<a href="#41v10">10)</a> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the chief baker:</span>
                
                <span id="41v11">(<a href="#41v11">11)</a> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</span>
                
                <span id="41v12">(<a href="#41v12">12)</a> And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</span>
                
                <span id="41v13">(<a href="#41v13">13)</a> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="41v14">(<a href="#41v14">14)</a> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</span>
                
                <span id="41v15">(<a href="#41v15">15)</a> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</span>
                
                <span id="41v16">(<a href="#41v16">16)</a> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</span>
                
                <span id="41v17">(<a href="#41v17">17)</a> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</span>
                
                <span id="41v18">(<a href="#41v18">18)</a> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</span>
                
                <span id="41v19">(<a href="#41v19">19)</a> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</span>
                
                <span id="41v20">(<a href="#41v20">20)</a> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</span>
                
                <span id="41v21">(<a href="#41v21">21)</a> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</span>
                
                <span id="41v22">(<a href="#41v22">22)</a> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</span>
                
                <span id="41v23">(<a href="#41v23">23)</a> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</span>
                
                <span id="41v24">(<a href="#41v24">24)</a> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.</span>
                
                <span id="41v25">(<a href="#41v25">25)</a> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.</span>
                
                <span id="41v26">(<a href="#41v26">26)</a> The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.</span>
                
                <span id="41v27">(<a href="#41v27">27)</a> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</span>
                
                <span id="41v28">(<a href="#41v28">28)</a> This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</span>
                
                <span id="41v29">(<a href="#41v29">29)</a> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</span>
                
                <span id="41v30">(<a href="#41v30">30)</a> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</span>
                
                <span id="41v31">(<a href="#41v31">31)</a> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.</span>
                
                <span id="41v32">(<a href="#41v32">32)</a> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span>
                
                <span id="41v33">(<a href="#41v33">33)</a> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</span>

                <span id="43v18">(<a href="#43v18">18)</a> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</span>
                
                <span id="43v19">(<a href="#43v19">19)</a> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</span>
                
                <span id="43v20">(<a href="#43v20">20)</a> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</span>
                
                <span id="43v21">(<a href="#43v21">21)</a> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, [every] man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</span>
                
                <span id="43v22">(<a href="#43v22">22)</a> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</span>
                
                <span id="43v23">(<a href="#43v23">23)</a> And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="43v24">(<a href="#43v24">24)</a> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</span>
                
                <span id="43v25">(<a href="#43v25">25)</a> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</span>

                <span id="43v26">(<a href="#43v26">26)</a> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</span>
                
                <span id="43v27">(<a href="#43v27">27)</a> And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said, [Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? [Is] he yet alive?</span>
                
                <span id="43v28">(<a href="#43v28">28)</a> And they answered, Thy servant our father [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</span>
                
                <span id="43v29">(<a href="#43v29">29)</a> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</span>
                
                <span id="43v30">(<a href="#43v30">30)</a> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and wept there.</span>
                
                <span id="43v31">(<a href="#43v31">31)</a> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</span>
                
                <span id="43v32">(<a href="#43v32">32)</a> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span>
                
                <span id="43v33">(<a href="#43v33">33)</a> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</span>
                
                <span id="43v34">(<a href="#43v34">34)</a> And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span>

                <span id="44v2">(<a href="#44v2">2)</a> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span>
                
                <span id="44v3">(<a href="#44v3">3)</a> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span>

                <span id="44v5">(<a href="#44v5">5)</a> [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</span>

                <span id="44v9">(<a href="#44v9">9)</a> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</span>

                <span id="44v11">(<a href="#44v11">11)</a> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span>
                
                <span id="44v12">(<a href="#44v12">12)</a> And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span>
                
                <span id="44v13">(<a href="#44v13">13)</a> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span>

                <span id="44v19">(<a href="#44v19">19)</a> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</span>

                <span id="44v21">(<a href="#44v21">21)</a> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</span>

                <span id="44v23">(<a href="#44v23">23)</a> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span>
                
                <span id="44v24">(<a href="#44v24">24)</a> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span>

                <span id="44v27">(<a href="#44v27">27)</a> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two [sons]:</span>

                <span id="44v30">(<a href="#44v30">30)</a> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad [be] not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</span>
                
                <span id="44v31">(<a href="#44v31">31)</a> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad [is] not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</span>
                
                <span id="44v32">(<a href="#44v32">32)</a> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="44v33">(<a href="#44v33">33)</a> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span>
                
                <span id="44v34">(<a href="#44v34">34)</a> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span>

                <span id="45v22">(<a href="#45v22">22)</a> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver, and five changes of raiment.</span>
                
                <span id="45v23">(<a href="#45v23">23)</a> And to his father he sent after this [manner]; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</span>
                
                <span id="45v24">(<a href="#45v24">24)</a> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</span>

                <span id="50v20">(<a href="#50v20">20)</a> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; [but] God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save much people alive.</span>
                
                <span id="50v21">(<a href="#50v21">21)</a> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</span>

                <span id="50v23">(<a href="#50v23">23)</a> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third [generation]: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</span>
                
                <span id="50v24">(<a href="#50v24">24)</a> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span>

                <span id="50v26">(<a href="#50v26">26)</a> So Joseph died, [being] an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span>
