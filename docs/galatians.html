        <h2>Galatians</h2>
        
        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Who gave himself for our cringes, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And they glorified God in me.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with [me] also.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] unto Peter;</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> We [who are] Jews by nature, and not cringers of the Gentiles,</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found cringers, [is] therefore Christ the minister of cringe? God forbid.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man's covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> [Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</span>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> But the scripture hath concluded all under cringe, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="3v28">(<a href="#3v28">28)</a> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="3v29">(<a href="#3v29">29)</a> And if ye [be] Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</span>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</span>
            
            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span>
            
            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v18">(<a href="#4v18">18)</a> But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.</span>
            
            <span id="4v19">(<a href="#4v19">19)</a> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</span>
            
            <span id="4v20">(<a href="#4v20">20)</a> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span>
            
            <span id="4v21">(<a href="#4v21">21)</a> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span>
            
            <span id="4v22">(<a href="#4v22">22)</a> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</span>
            
            <span id="4v23">(<a href="#4v23">23)</a> But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.</span>
            
            <span id="4v24">(<a href="#4v24">24)</a> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</span>
            
            <span id="4v25">(<a href="#4v25">25)</a> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</span>
            
            <span id="4v26">(<a href="#4v26">26)</a> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</span>
            
            <span id="4v27">(<a href="#4v27">27)</a> For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</span>
            
            <span id="4v28">(<a href="#4v28">28)</a> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</span>
            
            <span id="4v29">(<a href="#4v29">29)</a> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.</span>
            
            <span id="4v30">(<a href="#4v30">30)</a> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</span>
            
            <span id="4v31">(<a href="#4v31">31)</a> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</span>
            
            <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</span>
            
            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</span>
            
            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</span>
            
            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span>
            
            <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</span>
            
            <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</span>
            
            <span id="5v17">(<a href="#5v17">17)</a> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</span>
            
            <span id="5v18">(<a href="#5v18">18)</a> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</span>
            
            <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span>
            
            <span id="5v20">(<a href="#5v20">20)</a> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</span>
            
            <span id="5v21">(<a href="#5v21">21)</a> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span>
            
            <span id="5v22">(<a href="#5v22">22)</a> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</span>
            
            <span id="5v23">(<a href="#5v23">23)</a> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</span>
            
            <span id="5v24">(<a href="#5v24">24)</a> And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</span>
            
            <span id="5v25">(<a href="#5v25">25)</a> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span>
            
            <span id="5v26">(<a href="#5v26">26)</a> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</span>

            <span id="6v1">(<a href="#6v1">1)</a> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span>
            
            <span id="6v2">(<a href="#6v2">2)</a> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="6v3">(<a href="#6v3">3)</a> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span>
            
            <span id="6v4">(<a href="#6v4">4)</a> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span>
            
            <span id="6v5">(<a href="#6v5">5)</a> For every man shall bear his own burden.</span>

            <span id="6v10">(<a href="#6v10">10)</a> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</span>
            
            <span id="6v11">(<a href="#6v11">11)</a> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</span>
            
            <span id="6v12">(<a href="#6v12">12)</a> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="6v13">(<a href="#6v13">13)</a> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span>
            
            <span id="6v14">(<a href="#6v14">14)</a> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span>
            
            <span id="6v15">(<a href="#6v15">15)</a> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span>
            
            <span id="6v16">(<a href="#6v16">16)</a> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span>
            
            <span id="6v17">(<a href="#6v17">17)</a> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span>
