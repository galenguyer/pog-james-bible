            <h2>2 Samuel</h2>
            
            <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here [am] I.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an Amalekite.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life [is] yet whole in me.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that [was] upon his head, and the bracelet that [was] on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that [were] with him:</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, [and] fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And David said unto him, Thy blood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Jasher.)</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span>
                
                <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, [thou wast] slain in thine high places.</span>
                
                <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</span>
                
                <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And his men that [were] with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, [That] the men of Jabesh-gilead [were they] that buried Saul.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, [even] unto Saul, and have buried him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Ish-bosheth Saul's son [was] forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which [pertained] to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which [is] in Gibeon.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel [was as] light of foot as a wild roe.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Then Abner looked behind him, and said, [Art] thou Asahel? And he answered, I [am].</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth [rib], that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that [lieth] before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</span>
                
                <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</span>
                
                <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</span>
                
                <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</span>
                
                <span id="2v30">(<a href="#2v30">30)</a> And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</span>
                
                <span id="2v31">(<a href="#2v31">31)</a> But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v32">(<a href="#2v32">32)</a> And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which [was in] Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</span>

                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</span>

                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And Saul had a concubine, whose name [was] Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, [Am] I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</span>

                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</span>

                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose [is] the land? saying [also], Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand [shall be] with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</span>

                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver [me] my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from [her] husband, [even] from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</span>

                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you:</span>
                
                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> Now then do [it]: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</span>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</span>
                
                <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that [were] with him a feast.</span>
                
                <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.

                <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> When Joab and all the host that [was] with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</span>
                
                <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</span>
                
                <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</span>
                
                <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew [it] not.</span>
                
                <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth [rib], that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="3v28">(<a href="#3v28">28)</a> And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are] guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</span>
                
                <span id="3v29">(<a href="#3v29">29)</a> Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</span>
                
                <span id="3v30">(<a href="#3v30">30)</a> So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</span>

                <span id="3v31">(<a href="#3v31">31)</a> And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David [himself] followed the bier.</span>
                
                <span id="3v32">(<a href="#3v32">32)</a> And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</span>
                
                <span id="3v33">(<a href="#3v33">33)</a> And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</span>
                
                <span id="3v34">(<a href="#3v34">34)</a> Thy hands [were] not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, [so] fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</span>
                
                <span id="3v35">(<a href="#3v35">35)</a> And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</span>
                
                <span id="3v36">(<a href="#3v36">36)</a> And all the people took notice [of it], and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</span>
                
                <span id="3v37">(<a href="#3v37">37)</a> For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</span>

                <span id="6v2">(<a href="#6v2">2)</a> And David arose, and went with all the people that [were] with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth [between] the cherubims.</span>
                
                <span id="6v3">(<a href="#6v3">3)</a> And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that [was] in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</span>
                
                <span id="6v4">(<a href="#6v4">4)</a> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which [was] at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</span>
                
                <span id="6v5">(<a href="#6v5">5)</a> And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</span>

                <span id="6v7">(<a href="#6v7">7)</a> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for [his] error; and there he died by the ark of God.</span>
                
                <span id="6v8">(<a href="#6v8">8)</a> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.</span>
                
                <span id="6v9">(<a href="#6v9">9)</a> And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</span>

                <span id="6v13">(<a href="#6v13">13)</a> And it was [so], that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</span>

                <span id="6v18">(<a href="#6v18">18)</a> And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</span>
                
                <span id="6v19">(<a href="#6v19">19)</a> And he dealt among all the people, [even] among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece [of flesh], and a flagon [of wine]. So all the people departed every one to his house.</span>

                <span id="6v20">(<a href="#6v20">20)</a> Then David returned to bless his household.

                <span id="6v21">(<a href="#6v21">21)</a> And David said unto Michal, [It was] before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="6v22">(<a href="#6v22">22)</a> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</span>
                
                <span id="6v23">(<a href="#6v23">23)</a> Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</span>

                <span id="9v5">(<a href="#9v5">5)</a> Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.</span>
                
                <span id="9v6">(<a href="#9v6">6)</a> Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!</span>

                <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> And he bowed himself, and said, What [is] thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I [am]?</span>

                <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</span>
                
                <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in [the fruits], that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table.

                <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.</span>
                
                <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name [was] Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba [were] servants unto Mephibosheth.</span>

                <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men [were].</span>
                
                <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell [some] of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span>

                <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</span>
                
                <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span>

                <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and [some] of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span>
                
                <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</span>

                <span id="12v16">(<a href="#12v16">16)</a> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</span>
                
                <span id="12v17">(<a href="#12v17">17)</a> And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</span>
                
                <span id="12v18">(<a href="#12v18">18)</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</span>
                
                <span id="12v19">(<a href="#12v19">19)</a> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</span>
                
                <span id="12v20">(<a href="#12v20">20)</a> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed [himself], and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</span>
                
                <span id="12v21">(<a href="#12v21">21)</a> Then said his servants unto him, What thing [is] this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</span>
                
                <span id="12v22">(<a href="#12v22">22)</a> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell [whether] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</span>
                
                <span id="12v23">(<a href="#12v23">23)</a> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</span>

                <span id="12v24">(<a href="#12v24">24)</a> And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</span>
                
                <span id="12v25">(<a href="#12v25">25)</a> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="12v26">(<a href="#12v26">26)</a> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</span>
                
                <span id="12v27">(<a href="#12v27">27)</a> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</span>
                
                <span id="12v28">(<a href="#12v28">28)</a> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</span>
                
                <span id="12v29">(<a href="#12v29">29)</a> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</span>
                
                <span id="12v30">(<a href="#12v30">30)</a> And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof [was] a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was [set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</span>
                
                <span id="12v31">(<a href="#12v31">31)</a> And he brought forth the people that [were] therein, and put [them] under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</span>

                <span id="13v1">(<a href="#13v1">1)</a> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name [was] Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</span>
                
                <span id="13v2">(<a href="#13v2">2)</a> And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she [was] a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</span>
                
                <span id="13v3">(<a href="#13v3">3)</a> But Amnon had a friend, whose name [was] Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab [was] a very subtil man.</span>
                
                <span id="13v4">(<a href="#13v4">4)</a> And he said unto him, Why [art] thou, [being] the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</span>
                
                <span id="13v5">(<a href="#13v5">5)</a> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see [it], and eat [it] at her hand.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v6">(<a href="#13v6">6)</a> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</span>
                
                <span id="13v7">(<a href="#13v7">7)</a> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</span>
                
                <span id="13v8">(<a href="#13v8">8)</a> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded [it], and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span>
                
                <span id="13v9">(<a href="#13v9">9)</a> And she took a pan, and poured [them] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</span>
                
                <span id="13v10">(<a href="#13v10">10)</a> And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought [them] into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span>
                
                <span id="13v11">(<a href="#13v11">11)</a> And when she had brought [them] unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</span>
                
                <span id="13v12">(<a href="#13v12">12)</a> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</span>
                
                <span id="13v13">(<a href="#13v13">13)</a> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</span>
                
                <span id="13v14">(<a href="#13v14">14)</a> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v15">(<a href="#13v15">15)</a> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her [was] greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</span>
                
                <span id="13v16">(<a href="#13v16">16)</a> And she said unto him, [There is] no cause: this evil in sending me away [is] greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</span>
                
                <span id="13v17">(<a href="#13v17">17)</a> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span>
                
                <span id="13v18">(<a href="#13v18">18)</a> And [she had] a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v19">(<a href="#13v19">19)</a> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that [was] on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</span>
                
                <span id="13v20">(<a href="#13v20">20)</a> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he [is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v21">(<a href="#13v21">21)</a> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</span>
                
                <span id="13v22">(<a href="#13v22">22)</a> And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="13v23">(<a href="#13v23">23)</a> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.</span>
                
                <span id="13v24">(<a href="#13v24">24)</a> And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</span>
                
                <span id="13v25">(<a href="#13v25">25)</a> And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</span>
                
                <span id="13v26">(<a href="#13v26">26)</a> Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</span>
                
                <span id="13v27">(<a href="#13v27">27)</a> But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v28">(<a href="#13v28">28)</a> Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span>
                
                <span id="13v29">(<a href="#13v29">29)</a> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="13v30">(<a href="#13v30">30)</a> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</span>
                
                <span id="13v31">(<a href="#13v31">31)</a> Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</span>
                
                <span id="13v32">(<a href="#13v32">32)</a> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose [that] they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span>
                
                <span id="13v33">(<a href="#13v33">33)</a> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</span>
                
                <span id="13v34">(<a href="#13v34">34)</a> But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</span>
                
                <span id="13v35">(<a href="#13v35">35)</a> And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</span>
                
                <span id="13v36">(<a href="#13v36">36)</a> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span>

                <span id="13v37">(<a href="#13v37">37)</a> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.</span>
                
                <span id="13v38">(<a href="#13v38">38)</a> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span>
                
                <span id="13v39">(<a href="#13v39">39)</a> And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span>

                <span id="14v2">(<a href="#14v2">2)</a> And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</span>
                
                <span id="14v3">(<a href="#14v3">3)</a> And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</span>

                <span id="14v5">(<a href="#14v5">5)</a> And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I [am] indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</span>
                
                <span id="14v6">(<a href="#14v6">6)</a> And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and [there was] none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</span>
                
                <span id="14v7">(<a href="#14v7">7)</a> And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon the earth.</span>
                
                <span id="14v8">(<a href="#14v8">8)</a> And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</span>
                
                <span id="14v9">(<a href="#14v9">9)</a> And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity [be] on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne [be] guiltless.</span>
                
                <span id="14v10">(<a href="#14v10">10)</a> And the king said, Whosoever saith [ought] unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</span>

                <span id="14v15">(<a href="#14v15">15)</a> Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, [it is] because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</span>
                
                <span id="14v16">(<a href="#14v16">16)</a> For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</span>
                
                <span id="14v17">(<a href="#14v17">17)</a> Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so [is] my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</span>
                
                <span id="14v18">(<a href="#14v18">18)</a> Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</span>
                
                <span id="14v19">(<a href="#14v19">19)</a> And the king said, [Is not] the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</span>
                
                <span id="14v20">(<a href="#14v20">20)</a> To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord [is] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all [things] that [are] in the earth.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="14v21">(<a href="#14v21">21)</a> And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</span>
                
                <span id="14v22">(<a href="#14v22">22)</a> And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</span>
                
                <span id="14v23">(<a href="#14v23">23)</a> So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="14v24">(<a href="#14v24">24)</a> And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="14v25">(<a href="#14v25">25)</a> But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</span>
                
                <span id="14v26">(<a href="#14v26">26)</a> And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</span>
                
                <span id="14v27">(<a href="#14v27">27)</a> And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name [was] Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="14v28">(<a href="#14v28">28)</a> So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.</span>
                
                <span id="14v29">(<a href="#14v29">29)</a> Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</span>
                
                <span id="14v30">(<a href="#14v30">30)</a> Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</span>
                
                <span id="14v31">(<a href="#14v31">31)</a> Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto [his] house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</span>
                
                <span id="14v32">(<a href="#14v32">32)</a> And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span>
                
                <span id="14v33">(<a href="#14v33">33)</a> So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</span>

                <span id="15v1">(<a href="#15v1">1)</a> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</span>
                
                <span id="15v2">(<a href="#15v2">2)</a> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art] thou?

                <span id="15v3">(<a href="#15v3">3)</a> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters [are] good and right; but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king to hear thee.</span>
                
                <span id="15v4">(<a href="#15v4">4)</a> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</span>
                
                <span id="15v5">(<a href="#15v5">5)</a> And it was [so], that when any man came nigh [to him] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</span>
                
                <span id="15v6">(<a href="#15v6">6)</a> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</span>

                <span id="15v7">(<a href="#15v7">7)</a> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</span>
                
                <span id="15v8">(<a href="#15v8">8)</a> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="15v9">(<a href="#15v9">9)</a> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</span>

                <span id="15v10">(<a href="#15v10">10)</a> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</span>
                
                <span id="15v11">(<a href="#15v11">11)</a> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were] called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</span>
                
                <span id="15v12">(<a href="#15v12">12)</a> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, [even] from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</span>

                <span id="15v15">(<a href="#15v15">15)</a> And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</span>
                
                <span id="15v16">(<a href="#15v16">16)</a> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, [which were] concubines, to keep the house.</span>
                
                <span id="15v17">(<a href="#15v17">17)</a> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</span>

                <span id="15v19">(<a href="#15v19">19)</a> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou [art] a stranger, and also an exile.</span>
                
                <span id="15v20">(<a href="#15v20">20)</a> Whereas thou camest [but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth [be] with thee.</span>
                
                <span id="15v21">(<a href="#15v21">21)</a> And Ittai answered the king, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</span>
                
                <span id="15v22">(<a href="#15v22">22)</a> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that [were] with him.</span>

                <span id="15v27">(<a href="#15v27">27)</a> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, [Art not] thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</span>
                
                <span id="15v28">(<a href="#15v28">28)</a> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</span>

                <span id="15v30">(<a href="#15v30">30)</a> And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</span>

                <span id="15v35">(<a href="#15v35">35)</a> And [hast thou] not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, [that] what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell [it] to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</span>

                <span id="16v14">(<a href="#16v14">14)</a> And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</span>

                <span id="16v15">(<a href="#16v15">15)</a> And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span>
                
                <span id="16v16">(<a href="#16v16">16)</a> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</span>
                
                <span id="16v17">(<a href="#16v17">17)</a> And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span>
                
                <span id="16v18">(<a href="#16v18">18)</a> And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span>
                
                <span id="16v19">(<a href="#16v19">19)</a> And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="16v20">(<a href="#16v20">20)</a> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</span>
                
                <span id="16v21">(<a href="#16v21">21)</a> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with thee be strong.</span>
                
                <span id="16v22">(<a href="#16v22">22)</a> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="16v23">(<a href="#16v23">23)</a> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span>
                
            </p>

            <p>
                
                <span id="17v1">(<a href="#17v1">1)</a> Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</span>
                
                <span id="17v2">(<a href="#17v2">2)</a> And I will come upon him while he [is] weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that [are] with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</span>
                
                <span id="17v3">(<a href="#17v3">3)</a> And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest [is] as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.</span>
                
                <span id="17v4">(<a href="#17v4">4)</a> And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="17v5">(<a href="#17v5">5)</a> Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</span>
                
                <span id="17v6">(<a href="#17v6">6)</a> And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not; speak thou.</span>
                
                <span id="17v7">(<a href="#17v7">7)</a> And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given [is] not good at this time.</span>
                
                <span id="17v8">(<a href="#17v8">8)</a> For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they [be] mighty men, and they [be] chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father [is] a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</span>
                
                <span id="17v9">(<a href="#17v9">9)</a> Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</span>
                
                <span id="17v10">(<a href="#17v10">10)</a> And he also [that is] valiant, whose heart [is] as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father [is] a mighty man, and [they] which [be] with him [are] valiant men.</span>
                
                <span id="17v11">(<a href="#17v11">11)</a> Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that [is] by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</span>
                
                <span id="17v12">(<a href="#17v12">12)</a> So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that [are] with him there shall not be left so much as one.</span>
                
                <span id="17v13">(<a href="#17v13">13)</a> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</span>
                
                <span id="17v14">(<a href="#17v14">14)</a> And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="17v15">(<a href="#17v15">15)</a> Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</span>
                
                <span id="17v16">(<a href="#17v16">16)</a> Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that [are] with him.</span>
                
                <span id="17v17">(<a href="#17v17">17)</a> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</span>
                
                <span id="17v18">(<a href="#17v18">18)</a> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</span>
                
                <span id="17v19">(<a href="#17v19">19)</a> And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</span>
                
                <span id="17v20">(<a href="#17v20">20)</a> And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where [is] Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find [them], they returned to Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="17v21">(<a href="#17v21">21)</a> And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</span>
                
                <span id="17v22">(<a href="#17v22">22)</a> Then David arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="17v23">(<a href="#17v23">23)</a> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span>
                
                <span id="17v24">(<a href="#17v24">24)</a> Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="17v25">(<a href="#17v25">25)</a> And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa [was] a man's son, whose name [was] Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</span>
                
                <span id="17v26">(<a href="#17v26">26)</a> So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</span>

                <span id="17v27">(<a href="#17v27">27)</a> And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span>
                
                <span id="17v28">(<a href="#17v28">28)</a> Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn], and beans, and lentiles, and parched [pulse],</span>
                
                <span id="17v29">(<a href="#17v29">29)</a> And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that [were] with him, to eat: for they said, The people [is] hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="18v1">(<a href="#18v1">1)</a> And David numbered the people that [were] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</span>
                
                <span id="18v2">(<a href="#18v2">2)</a> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</span>
                
                <span id="18v3">(<a href="#18v3">3)</a> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now [it is] better that thou succour us out of the city.</span>
                
                <span id="18v4">(<a href="#18v4">4)</a> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</span>
                
                <span id="18v5">(<a href="#18v5">5)</a> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="18v6">(<a href="#18v6">6)</a> So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</span>
                
                <span id="18v7">(<a href="#18v7">7)</a> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand [men].</span>
                
                <span id="18v8">(<a href="#18v8">8)</a> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="18v9">(<a href="#18v9">9)</a> And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away.</span>
                
                <span id="18v10">(<a href="#18v10">10)</a> And a certain man saw [it], and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</span>
                
                <span id="18v11">(<a href="#18v11">11)</a> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [shekels] of silver, and a girdle.</span>
                
                <span id="18v12">(<a href="#18v12">12)</a> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [shekels] of silver in mine hand, [yet] would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none [touch] the young man Absalom.</span>
                
                <span id="18v13">(<a href="#18v13">13)</a> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me].</span>
                
                <span id="18v14">(<a href="#18v14">14)</a> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he [was] yet alive in the midst of the oak.</span>
                
                <span id="18v15">(<a href="#18v15">15)</a> And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</span>
                
                <span id="18v16">(<a href="#18v16">16)</a> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</span>
                
                <span id="18v17">(<a href="#18v17">17)</a> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="18v18">(<a href="#18v18">18)</a> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</span>
                
                <span id="18v19">(<a href="#18v19">19)</a> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</span>
                
                <span id="18v20">(<a href="#18v20">20)</a> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</span>
                
                <span id="18v21">(<a href="#18v21">21)</a> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</span>
                
                <span id="18v22">(<a href="#18v22">22)</a> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</span>
                
                <span id="18v23">(<a href="#18v23">23)</a> But howsoever, [said he], let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</span>
                
                <span id="18v24">(<a href="#18v24">24)</a> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</span>
                
                <span id="18v25">(<a href="#18v25">25)</a> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</span>
                
                <span id="18v26">(<a href="#18v26">26)</a> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</span>
                
                <span id="18v27">(<a href="#18v27">27)</a> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</span>
                
                <span id="18v28">(<a href="#18v28">28)</a> And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</span>
                
                <span id="18v29">(<a href="#18v29">29)</a> And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was].</span>
                
                <span id="18v30">(<a href="#18v30">30)</a> And the king said [unto him], Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</span>
                
                <span id="18v31">(<a href="#18v31">31)</a> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</span>
                
                <span id="18v32">(<a href="#18v32">32)</a> And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do [thee] hurt, be as [that] young man [is].</span>

                <span id="19v2">(<a href="#19v2">2)</a> And the victory that day was [turned] into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</span>
                
                <span id="19v3">(<a href="#19v3">3)</a> And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</span>

                <span id="19v5">(<a href="#19v5">5)</a> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</span>
                
                <span id="19v6">(<a href="#19v6">6)</a> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.

                <span id="19v7">(<a href="#19v7">7)</a> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</span>

                <span id="19v10">(<a href="#19v10">10)</a> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</span>

                <span id="19v12">(<a href="#19v12">12)</a> Ye [are] my brethren, ye [are] my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</span>

                <span id="19v14">(<a href="#19v14">14)</a> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent [this word] unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</span>
                
                <span id="19v15">(<a href="#19v15">15)</a> So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</span>

                <span id="19v19">(<a href="#19v19">19)</a> And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</span>
                
                <span id="19v20">(<a href="#19v20">20)</a> For thy servant doth know that I have cringed: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</span>
                
                <span id="19v21">(<a href="#19v21">21)</a> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?</span>
                
                <span id="19v22">(<a href="#19v22">22)</a> And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I [am] this day king over Israel?</span>
                
                <span id="19v23">(<a href="#19v23">23)</a> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</span>

                <span id="19v25">(<a href="#19v25">25)</a> And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</span>
                
                <span id="19v26">(<a href="#19v26">26)</a> And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant [is] lame.</span>
                
                <span id="19v27">(<a href="#19v27">27)</a> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king [is] as an angel of God: do therefore [what is] good in thine eyes.</span>
                
                <span id="19v28">(<a href="#19v28">28)</a> For all [of] my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</span>
                
                <span id="19v29">(<a href="#19v29">29)</a> And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</span>
                
                <span id="19v30">(<a href="#19v30">30)</a> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</span>

                <span id="19v31">(<a href="#19v31">31)</a> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</span>
                
                <span id="19v32">(<a href="#19v32">32)</a> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, [even] fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he [was] a very great man.</span>
                
                <span id="19v33">(<a href="#19v33">33)</a> And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</span>

                <span id="19v36">(<a href="#19v36">36)</a> Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</span>

                <span id="19v38">(<a href="#19v38">38)</a> And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, [that] will I do for thee.</span>
                
                <span id="19v39">(<a href="#19v39">39)</a> And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</span>
                
                <span id="19v40">(<a href="#19v40">40)</a> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</span>

                <span id="19v41">(<a href="#19v41">41)</a> And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</span>
                
                <span id="19v42">(<a href="#19v42">42)</a> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king [is] near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's [cost]? or hath he given us any gift?</span>
                
                <span id="19v43">(<a href="#19v43">43)</a> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?

                <span id="20v1">(<a href="#20v1">1)</a> And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name [was] Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="20v2">(<a href="#20v2">2)</a> So every man of Israel went up from after David, [and] followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</span>

                <span id="20v4">(<a href="#20v4">4)</a> Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</span>

                <span id="20v7">(<a href="#20v7">7)</a> And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span>
                
                <span id="20v8">(<a href="#20v8">8)</a> When they [were] at the great stone which [is] in Gibeon, Amasa went before them.

                <span id="20v9">(<a href="#20v9">9)</a> And Joab said to Amasa, [Art] thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</span>
                
                <span id="20v10">(<a href="#20v10">10)</a> But Amasa took no heed to the sword that [was] in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth [rib], and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span>
                
                <span id="20v11">(<a href="#20v11">11)</a> And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that [is] for David, [let him go] after Joab.</span>
                
                <span id="20v12">(<a href="#20v12">12)</a> And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.

                <span id="20v13">(<a href="#20v13">13)</a> When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span>

                <span id="20v14">(<a href="#20v14">14)</a> And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</span>
                
                <span id="20v15">(<a href="#20v15">15)</a> And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that [were] with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</span>

                <span id="20v16">(<a href="#20v16">16)</a> Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</span>
                
                <span id="20v17">(<a href="#20v17">17)</a> And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, [Art] thou Joab? And he answered, I [am he]. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</span>
                
                <span id="20v18">(<a href="#20v18">18)</a> Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].</span>
                
                <span id="20v19">(<a href="#20v19">19)</a> I [am one of them that are] peaceable [and] faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</span>
                
                <span id="20v20">(<a href="#20v20">20)</a> And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</span>
                
                <span id="20v21">(<a href="#20v21">21)</a> The matter [is] not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, [even] against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</span>
                
                <span id="20v22">(<a href="#20v22">22)</a> Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast [it] out to Joab.

                <span id="23v10">(<a href="#23v10">10)</a> He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</span>

                <span id="23v16">(<a href="#23v16">16)</a> And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</span>

                <span id="24v3">(<a href="#24v3">3)</a> And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see [it]: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</span>
                
                <span id="24v4">(<a href="#24v4">4)</a> Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</span>

                <span id="24v5">(<a href="#24v5">5)</a> And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [lieth] in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</span>
                
                <span id="24v6">(<a href="#24v6">6)</a> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,</span>
                
                <span id="24v7">(<a href="#24v7">7)</a> And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, [even] to Beer-sheba.</span>
                
                <span id="24v8">(<a href="#24v8">8)</a> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</span>
                
                <span id="24v9">(<a href="#24v9">9)</a> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.</span>

                <span id="24v10">(<a href="#24v10">10)</a> And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.

                <span id="24v11">(<a href="#24v11">11)</a> For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="24v12">(<a href="#24v12">12)</a> Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three [things]; choose thee one of them, that I may [do it] unto thee.</span>
                
                <span id="24v13">(<a href="#24v13">13)</a> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span>
                
                <span id="24v14">(<a href="#24v14">14)</a> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies [are] great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="24v15">(<a href="#24v15">15)</a> So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.</span>
                
                <span id="24v16">(<a href="#24v16">16)</a> And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</span>
                
                <span id="24v17">(<a href="#24v17">17)</a> And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have cringed, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</span>
                
                <span id="24v18">(<a href="#24v18">18)</a> And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</span>
                
                <span id="24v19">(<a href="#24v19">19)</a> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</span>
                
                <span id="24v20">(<a href="#24v20">20)</a> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</span>
                
                <span id="24v21">(<a href="#24v21">21)</a> And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span>
                
                <span id="24v22">(<a href="#24v22">22)</a> And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seemeth] good unto him: behold, [here be] oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood.</span>
                
                <span id="24v23">(<a href="#24v23">23)</a> All these [things] did Araunah, [as] a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</span>
                
                <span id="24v24">(<a href="#24v24">24)</a> And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span>
                
                <span id="24v25">(<a href="#24v25">25)</a> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span>
