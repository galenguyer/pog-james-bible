        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their meat] under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was] Kirjath-sepher:</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off [her] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which [lieth] in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out [the inhabitants of] the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD [was] with them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-el. (Now the name of the city before [was] Luz.)</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which [is] the name thereof unto this day.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</span>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</span>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> And the coast of the Amorites [was] from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] an hundred and ten years old.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that [were] round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; [but] they did not so.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, [that] they returned, and corrupted [themselves] more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep [it], or not.</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> [Namely], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon [was] a very fat man.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of [his] seat.</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened [them]: and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</span>
            
            <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v28">(<a href="#3v28">28)</a> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span>
            
            <span id="3v29">(<a href="#3v29">29)</a> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</span>
            
            <span id="3v30">(<a href="#3v30">30)</a> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span>

            <span id="4v21">(<a href="#4v21">21)</a> Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</span>

            <span id="6v23">(<a href="#6v23">23)</a> And the LORD said unto him, Peace [be] unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</span>
            
            <span id="6v24">(<a href="#6v24">24)</a> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it [is] yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v25">(<a href="#6v25">25)</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that [is] by it:</span>
            
            <span id="6v26">(<a href="#6v26">26)</a> And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</span>
            
            <span id="6v27">(<a href="#6v27">27)</a> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and [so] it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do [it] by day, that he did [it] by night.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v28">(<a href="#6v28">28)</a> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that [was] by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar [that was] built.</span>
            
            <span id="6v29">(<a href="#6v29">29)</a> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</span>
            
            <span id="6v30">(<a href="#6v30">30)</a> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that [was] by it.</span>
            
            <span id="6v31">(<a href="#6v31">31)</a> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst [it is yet] morning: if he [be] a god, let him plead for himself, because [one] hath cast down his altar.</span>
            
            <span id="6v32">(<a href="#6v32">32)</a> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v33">(<a href="#6v33">33)</a> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</span>
            
            <span id="6v34">(<a href="#6v34">34)</a> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v35">(<a href="#6v35">35)</a> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v36">(<a href="#6v36">36)</a> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</span>
            
            <span id="6v37">(<a href="#6v37">37)</a> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; [and] if the dew be on the fleece only, and [it be] dry upon all the earth [beside], then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</span>
            
            <span id="6v38">(<a href="#6v38">38)</a> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</span>
            
            <span id="6v39">(<a href="#6v39">39)</a> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span>
            
            <span id="6v40">(<a href="#6v40">40)</a> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span>

        <h3 id="7"><a href="#7">Chapter 7</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> Then Jerubbaal, who [is] Gideon, and all the people that [were] with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</span>
            
            <span id="7v2">(<a href="#7v2">2)</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that [are] with thee [are] too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</span>
            
            <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever [is] fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span>
            
            <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people [are] yet [too] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, [that] of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</span>
            
            <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</span>
            
            <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> And the number of them that lapped, [putting] their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</span>
            
            <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the [other] people go every man unto his place.</span>
            
            <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all [the rest of] Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</span>
            
            <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that [were] in the host.</span>
            
            <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels [were] without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</span>
            
            <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> And when Gideon was come, behold, [there was] a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</span>
            
            <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> And his fellow answered and said, This [is] nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: [for] into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> And it was [so], when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</span>
            
            <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> And he divided the three hundred men [into] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span>
            
            <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be [that], as I do, so shall ye do.</span>
            
            <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that [are] with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, [The sword] of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> So Gideon, and the hundred men that [were] with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that [were] in their hands.</span>
            
            <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow [withal]: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span>
            
            <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</span>
            
            <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, [and] to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.</span>
            
            <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.</span>
            
            <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</span>

            <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.</span>
            
            <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</span>
            
            <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> And Gideon came to Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three hundred men that [were] with him, faint, yet pursuing [them].</span>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered [him].</span>

            <span id="8v19">(<a href="#8v19">19)</a> And he said, They [were] my brethren, [even] the sons of my mother: [as] the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</span>
            
            <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, [and] slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he [was] yet a youth.</span>
            
            <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man [is, so is] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels' necks.</span>

            <span id="8v24">(<a href="#8v24">24)</a> And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they [were] Ishmaelites.)</span>
            
            <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> And they answered, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</span>
            
            <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that [was] on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that [were] about their camels' necks.</span>
            
            <span id="8v27">(<a href="#8v27">27)</a> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, [even] in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="9v34">(<a href="#9v34">34)</a> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that [were] with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</span>

            <span id="9v36">(<a href="#9v36">36)</a> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as [if they were] men.</span>
            
            <span id="9v37">(<a href="#9v37">37)</a> And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</span>
            
            <span id="9v38">(<a href="#9v38">38)</a> Then said Zebul unto him, Where [is] now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who [is] Abimelech, that we should serve him? [is] not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</span>
            
            <span id="9v39">(<a href="#9v39">39)</a> And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</span>
            
            <span id="9v40">(<a href="#9v40">40)</a> And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown [and] wounded, [even] unto the entering of the gate.</span>
            
            <span id="9v41">(<a href="#9v41">41)</a> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</span>
            
            <span id="9v42">(<a href="#9v42">42)</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</span>
            
            <span id="9v43">(<a href="#9v43">43)</a> And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people [were] come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</span>
            
            <span id="9v44">(<a href="#9v44">44)</a> And Abimelech, and the company that [was] with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two [other] companies ran upon all [the people] that [were] in the fields, and slew them.</span>
            
            <span id="9v45">(<a href="#9v45">45)</a> And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that [was] therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="9v46">(<a href="#9v46">46)</a> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [that], they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</span>
            
            <span id="9v47">(<a href="#9v47">47)</a> And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</span>
            
            <span id="9v48">(<a href="#9v48">48)</a> And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that [were] with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid [it] on his shoulder, and said unto the people that [were] with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, [and] do as I [have done].</span>
            
            <span id="9v49">(<a href="#9v49">49)</a> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v50">(<a href="#9v50">50)</a> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</span>
            
            <span id="9v51">(<a href="#9v51">51)</a> But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut [it] to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.</span>
            
            <span id="9v52">(<a href="#9v52">52)</a> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</span>
            
            <span id="9v53">(<a href="#9v53">53)</a> And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.</span>
            
            <span id="9v54">(<a href="#9v54">54)</a> Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</span>
            
            <span id="9v55">(<a href="#9v55">55)</a> And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="9v56">(<a href="#9v56">56)</a> Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</span>

            <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</span>
            
            <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.</span>
            
            <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?</span>
            
            <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</span>
            
            <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?</span>
            
            <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.</span>
            
            <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.</span>

            <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?</span>
            
            <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.</span>
            
            <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</span>
            
            <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</span>
            
            <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;</span>
            
            <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken [thereto].

            <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon [was] the border of Moab.</span>
            
            <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</span>
            
            <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span>
            
            <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</span>
            
            <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?</span>
            
            <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</span>
            
            <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> And now [art] thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</span>
            
            <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that [be] along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover [them] within that time?</span>
            
            <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> Wherefore I have not cringed against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span>
            
            <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over [unto] the children of Ammon.</span>
            
            <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</span>
            
            <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="11v32">(<a href="#11v32">32)</a> So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</span>
            
            <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, [even] twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="11v34">(<a href="#11v34">34)</a> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she [was his] only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</span>
            
            <span id="11v35">(<a href="#11v35">35)</a> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</span>
            
            <span id="11v36">(<a href="#11v36">36)</a> And she said unto him, My father, [if] thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, [even] of the children of Ammon.</span>
            
            <span id="11v37">(<a href="#11v37">37)</a> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</span>
            
            <span id="11v38">(<a href="#11v38">38)</a> And he said, Go. And he sent her away [for] two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</span>
            
            <span id="11v39">(<a href="#11v39">39)</a> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her [according] to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</span>
            
            <span id="11v40">(<a href="#11v40">40)</a> [That] the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</span>

            <span id="12v1">(<a href="#12v1">1)</a> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.</span>
            
            <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.</span>
            
            <span id="12v3">(<a href="#12v3">3)</a> And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</span>
            
            <span id="12v4">(<a href="#12v4">4)</a> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites.</span>
            
            <span id="12v5">(<a href="#12v5">5)</a> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was [so], that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, [Art] thou an Ephraimite?

            <span id="14v4">(<a href="#14v4">4)</a> But his father and his mother knew not that it [was] of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="14v5">(<a href="#14v5">5)</a> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</span>
            
            <span id="14v6">(<a href="#14v6">6)</a> And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [he had] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</span>
            
            <span id="14v7">(<a href="#14v7">7)</a> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v8">(<a href="#14v8">8)</a> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, [there was] a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</span>
            
            <span id="14v9">(<a href="#14v9">9)</a> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v10">(<a href="#14v10">10)</a> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span>
            
            <span id="14v11">(<a href="#14v11">11)</a> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="14v12">(<a href="#14v12">12)</a> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</span>
            
            <span id="14v13">(<a href="#14v13">13)</a> But if ye cannot declare [it] me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</span>
            
            <span id="14v14">(<a href="#14v14">14)</a> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</span>
            
            <span id="14v15">(<a href="#14v15">15)</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? [is it] not [so]?</span>
            
            <span id="14v16">(<a href="#14v16">16)</a> And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told [it] me.

            <span id="14v17">(<a href="#14v17">17)</a> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span>
            
            <span id="14v18">(<a href="#14v18">18)</a> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion?

            <span id="14v19">(<a href="#14v19">19)</a> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.

            <span id="14v20">(<a href="#14v20">20)</a> But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</span>

            <span id="15v2">(<a href="#15v2">2)</a> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: [is] not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</span>

            <span id="15v15">(<a href="#15v15">15)</a> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</span>

            <span id="16v8">(<a href="#16v8">8)</a> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</span>
            
            <span id="16v9">(<a href="#16v9">9)</a> Now [there were] men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson.

            <span id="16v10">(<a href="#16v10">10)</a> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</span>
            
            <span id="16v11">(<a href="#16v11">11)</a> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</span>
            
            <span id="16v12">(<a href="#16v12">12)</a> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And [there were] liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</span>
            
            <span id="16v13">(<a href="#16v13">13)</a> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</span>

            <span id="16v18">(<a href="#16v18">18)</a> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.

            <span id="16v20">(<a href="#16v20">20)</a> And she said, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</span>

            <span id="16v22">(<a href="#16v22">22)</a> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</span>
            
            <span id="16v23">(<a href="#16v23">23)</a> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</span>
            
            <span id="16v24">(<a href="#16v24">24)</a> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</span>
            
            <span id="16v25">(<a href="#16v25">25)</a> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</span>
            
            <span id="16v26">(<a href="#16v26">26)</a> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</span>
            
            <span id="16v27">(<a href="#16v27">27)</a> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines [were] there; and [there were] upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</span>
            
            <span id="16v28">(<a href="#16v28">28)</a> And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</span>
            
            <span id="16v29">(<a href="#16v29">29)</a> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</span>
            
            <span id="16v30">(<a href="#16v30">30)</a> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] therein.

            <span id="16v31">(<a href="#16v31">31)</a> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought [him] up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</span>

            <span id="20v9">(<a href="#20v9">9)</a> But now this [shall be] the thing which we will do to Gibeah; [we will go up] by lot against it;</span>
            
            <span id="20v10">(<a href="#20v10">10)</a> And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="20v11">(<a href="#20v11">11)</a> So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="20v12">(<a href="#20v12">12)</a> And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness [is] this that is done among you?</span>
            
            <span id="20v13">(<a href="#20v13">13)</a> Now therefore deliver [us] the men, the children of Belial, which [are] in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:</span>
            
            <span id="20v14">(<a href="#20v14">14)</a> But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="20v15">(<a href="#20v15">15)</a> And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</span>
            
            <span id="20v16">(<a href="#20v16">16)</a> Among all this people [there were] seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair [breadth], and not miss.</span>
            
            <span id="20v17">(<a href="#20v17">17)</a> And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these [were] men of war.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="20v18">(<a href="#20v18">18)</a> And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?

            <span id="20v19">(<a href="#20v19">19)</a> And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</span>
            
            <span id="20v20">(<a href="#20v20">20)</a> And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</span>
            
            <span id="20v21">(<a href="#20v21">21)</a> And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</span>
            
            <span id="20v22">(<a href="#20v22">22)</a> And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</span>
            
            <span id="20v23">(<a href="#20v23">23)</a> (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?

            <span id="20v24">(<a href="#20v24">24)</a> And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</span>
            
            <span id="20v25">(<a href="#20v25">25)</a> And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="20v26">(<a href="#20v26">26)</a> Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="20v27">(<a href="#20v27">27)</a> And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God [was] there in those days,</span>
            
            <span id="20v28">(<a href="#20v28">28)</a> And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="20v29">(<a href="#20v29">29)</a> And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</span>
            
            <span id="20v30">(<a href="#20v30">30)</a> And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</span>
            
            <span id="20v31">(<a href="#20v31">31)</a> And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, [and] were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, [and] kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="20v32">(<a href="#20v32">32)</a> And the children of Benjamin said, They [are] smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</span>
            
            <span id="20v33">(<a href="#20v33">33)</a> And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, [even] out of the meadows of Gibeah.</span>
            
            <span id="20v34">(<a href="#20v34">34)</a> And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil [was] near them.</span>
            
            <span id="20v35">(<a href="#20v35">35)</a> And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</span>
            
            <span id="20v36">(<a href="#20v36">36)</a> So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</span>
            
            <span id="20v37">(<a href="#20v37">37)</a> And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew [themselves] along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</span>
            
            <span id="20v38">(<a href="#20v38">38)</a> Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</span>
            
            <span id="20v39">(<a href="#20v39">39)</a> And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite [and] kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as [in] the first battle.</span>
            
            <span id="20v40">(<a href="#20v40">40)</a> But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="20v41">(<a href="#20v41">41)</a> And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</span>
            
            <span id="20v42">(<a href="#20v42">42)</a> Therefore they turned [their backs] before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which [came] out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</span>
            
            <span id="20v43">(<a href="#20v43">43)</a> [Thus] they inclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them, [and] trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</span>
            
            <span id="20v44">(<a href="#20v44">44)</a> And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valour.</span>
            
            <span id="20v45">(<a href="#20v45">45)</a> And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</span>
            
            <span id="20v46">(<a href="#20v46">46)</a> So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these [were] men of valour.</span>
            
            <span id="20v47">(<a href="#20v47">47)</a> But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</span>
            
            <span id="20v48">(<a href="#20v48">48)</a> And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of [every] city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</span>

            <span id="21v1">(<a href="#21v1">1)</a> Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="21v2">(<a href="#21v2">2)</a> And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</span>
            
            <span id="21v3">(<a href="#21v3">3)</a> And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</span>
            
            <span id="21v4">(<a href="#21v4">4)</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</span>
            
            <span id="21v5">(<a href="#21v5">5)</a> And the children of Israel said, Who [is there] among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?

            <span id="21v6">(<a href="#21v6">6)</a> And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span>
            
            <span id="21v7">(<a href="#21v7">7)</a> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="21v8">(<a href="#21v8">8)</a> And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.</span>
            
            <span id="21v9">(<a href="#21v9">9)</a> For the people were numbered, and, behold, [there were] none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</span>
            
            <span id="21v10">(<a href="#21v10">10)</a> And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</span>
            
            <span id="21v11">(<a href="#21v11">11)</a> And this [is] the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</span>
            
            <span id="21v12">(<a href="#21v12">12)</a> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan.</span>
            
            <span id="21v13">(<a href="#21v13">13)</a> And the whole congregation sent [some] to speak to the children of Benjamin that [were] in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="21v14">(<a href="#21v14">14)</a> And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</span>
            
            <span id="21v15">(<a href="#21v15">15)</a> And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="21v16">(<a href="#21v16">16)</a> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</span>
            
            <span id="21v17">(<a href="#21v17">17)</a> And they said, [There must be] an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="21v18">(<a href="#21v18">18)</a> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed [be] he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</span>
            
            <span id="21v19">(<a href="#21v19">19)</a> Then they said, Behold, [there is] a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly [in a place] which [is] on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</span>
            
            <span id="21v20">(<a href="#21v20">20)</a> Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</span>
            
            <span id="21v21">(<a href="#21v21">21)</a> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span>
            
            <span id="21v22">(<a href="#21v22">22)</a> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, [that] ye should be guilty.</span>
            
            <span id="21v23">(<a href="#21v23">23)</a> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took [them] wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</span>
            
            <span id="21v24">(<a href="#21v24">24)</a> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</span>
            
            <span id="21v25">(<a href="#21v25">25)</a> In those days [there was] no king in Israel: every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.</span>
