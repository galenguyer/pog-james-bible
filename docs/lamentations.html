        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> How doth the city sit solitary, [that was] full of people! [how] is she become as a widow! she [that was] great among the nations, [and] princess among the provinces, [how] is she become tributary!</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort [her]: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts [that] find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, [and] did mock at her sabbaths.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Jerusalem hath grievously cringed; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Her filthiness [is] in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified [himself].</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen [that] the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command [that] they should not enter into thy congregation.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> [Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, [and] come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into [their] hands, [from whom] I am not able to rise up.</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, [as] in a winepress.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> For these [things] I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Zion spreadeth forth her hands, [and there is] none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Behold, O LORD; for I [am] in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home [there is] as death.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> They have heard that I sigh: [there is] none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done [it]: thou wilt bring the day [that] thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint.</span>

        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, [and] cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought [them] down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> He hath cut off in [his] fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, [which] devoureth round about.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all [that were] pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as [if it were of] a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes [are] among the Gentiles: the law [is] no [more]; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, [and] keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> They say to their mothers, Where [is] corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach [is] great like the sea: who can heal thee?</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying, Is] this the city that [men] call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up: certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen [it].</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> The LORD hath done [that] which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused [thine] enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, [and] children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain [them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, [and] not pitied.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</span>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> I [am] the man [that] hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> He hath led me, and brought [me into] darkness, but not [into] light.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand [against me] all the day.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> He hath builded against me, and compassed [me] with gall and travail.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> He hath set me in dark places, as [they that be] dead of old.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> He [was] unto me [as] a bear lying in wait, [and as] a lion in secret places.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> I was a derision to all my people; [and] their song all the day.</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</span>

            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> [It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</span>

            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> The LORD [is] my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> The LORD [is] good unto them that wait for him, to the soul [that] seeketh him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> [It is] good that [a man] should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> [It is] good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v28">(<a href="#3v28">28)</a> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne [it] upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="3v29">(<a href="#3v29">29)</a> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</span>
            
            <span id="3v30">(<a href="#3v30">30)</a> He giveth [his] cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</span>
            
            <span id="3v31">(<a href="#3v31">31)</a> For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</span>
            
            <span id="3v32">(<a href="#3v32">32)</a> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</span>
