            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> From the sole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Your country [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span>

            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them].</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your cringes be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].</span>

            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> Thy princes [are] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the cringers [shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them].</span>

            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</span>

            <span id="37v18">(<a href="#37v18">18)</a> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,</span>
            
            <span id="37v19">(<a href="#37v19">19)</a> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</span>

            <span id="37v22">(<a href="#37v22">22)</a> This [is] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</span>
            
            <span id="37v23">(<a href="#37v23">23)</a> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="37v24">(<a href="#37v24">24)</a> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, [and] the forest of his Carmel.</span>
            
            <span id="37v25">(<a href="#37v25">25)</a> I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</span>

            <span id="37v30">(<a href="#37v30">30)</a> And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat [this] year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="37v31">(<a href="#37v31">31)</a> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</span>
