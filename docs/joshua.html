            <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, [even] to the children of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, [so] I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Whosoever [he be] that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they [were]:</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And it came to pass [about the time] of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that [were] on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And as soon as we had heard [these things], our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he [is] God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And [that] ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> And the men answered her, Our life for your's, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house [was] upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And the men said unto her, We [will be] blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Behold, [when] we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> And it shall be, [that] whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood [shall be] upon his head, and we [will be] guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head, if [any] hand be upon him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And she said, According unto your words, so [be] it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought [them] throughout all the way, but found [them] not.</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all [things] that befell them:</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed [this] way heretofore.</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, [so] I will be with thee.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God [is] among you, and [that] he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, [that] the waters of Jordan shall be cut off [from] the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> That the waters which came down from above stood [and] rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that [is] beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, failed, [and] were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</span>
                
                <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</span>

                <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</span>
                
                <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</span>

                <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> And [so] it was, [that] all that fell that day, both of men and women, [were] twelve thousand, [even] all the men of Ai.</span>
                
                <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span>

                <span id="9v18">(<a href="#9v18">18)</a> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</span>
                
                <span id="9v19">(<a href="#9v19">19)</a> But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</span>
                
                <span id="9v20">(<a href="#9v20">20)</a> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="9v21">(<a href="#9v21">21)</a> And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</span>

                <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We [are] very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</span>
                
                <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span>
                
                <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</span>
                
                <span id="9v25">(<a href="#9v25">25)</a> And now, behold, we [are] in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</span>

                <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</span>

                <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</span>
                
                <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> That they feared greatly, because Gibeon [was] a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [was] greater than Ai, and all the men thereof [were] mighty.</span>
                
                <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span>
                
                <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</span>
                
                <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</span>

                <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</span>
                
                <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, [and] went up from Gilgal all night.</span>
                
                <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</span>
                
                <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, [and] were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: [they were] more which died with hailstones than [they] whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</span>
                
                <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.

                <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</span>

                <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span>
                
                <span id="10v16">(<a href="#10v16">16)</a> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span>
                
                <span id="10v17">(<a href="#10v17">17)</a> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span>
                
                <span id="10v18">(<a href="#10v18">18)</a> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</span>
                
                <span id="10v19">(<a href="#10v19">19)</a> And stay ye not, [but] pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</span>
                
                <span id="10v20">(<a href="#10v20">20)</a> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest [which] remained of them entered into fenced cities.</span>
                
                <span id="10v21">(<a href="#10v21">21)</a> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="10v22">(<a href="#10v22">22)</a> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span>
                
                <span id="10v23">(<a href="#10v23">23)</a> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon.</span>
                
                <span id="10v24">(<a href="#10v24">24)</a> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span>
                
                <span id="10v25">(<a href="#10v25">25)</a> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span>
                
                <span id="10v26">(<a href="#10v26">26)</a> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span>
                
                <span id="10v27">(<a href="#10v27">27)</a> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, [that] Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, [which remain] until this very day.</span>

                <span id="10v28">(<a href="#10v28">28)</a> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that [were] therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span>
                
                <span id="10v29">(<a href="#10v29">29)</a> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span>

                <span id="24v23">(<a href="#24v23">23)</a> Now therefore put away, [said he], the strange gods which [are] among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="24v24">(<a href="#24v24">24)</a> And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</span>
                
                <span id="24v25">(<a href="#24v25">25)</a> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span>

                <span id="24v26">(<a href="#24v26">26)</a> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that [was] by the sanctuary of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="24v27">(<a href="#24v27">27)</a> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</span>
                
                <span id="24v28">(<a href="#24v28">28)</a> So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</span>

                <span id="24v29">(<a href="#24v29">29)</a> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] an hundred and ten years old.</span>
                
                <span id="24v30">(<a href="#24v30">30)</a> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which [is] in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</span>
                
                <span id="24v31">(<a href="#24v31">31)</a> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</span>

                <span id="24v32">(<a href="#24v32">32)</a> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</span>
                
                <span id="24v33">(<a href="#24v33">33)</a> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill [that pertained to] Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</span>
