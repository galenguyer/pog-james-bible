            <p>
                
                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother,</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span>
                
                <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span>
                
                <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</span>
                
                <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</span>
                
                <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</span>
                
                <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> That no flesh should glory in his presence.</span>
                
                <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</span>
                
                <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</span>
                
                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span>
                
                <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span>
                
                <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;</span>
                
                <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;</span>
                
                <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> And ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.</span>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</span>
                
                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</span>
                
                <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</span>
                
                <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</span>
                
                <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn among us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</span>

                <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</span>

                <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.</span>
                
                <span id="7v2">(<a href="#7v2">2)</a> Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</span>
                
                <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</span>
                
                <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</span>
                
                <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> Defraud ye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</span>
                
                <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment.</span>
                
                <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span>
                
                <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span>
                
                <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</span>
                
                <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:</span>
                
                <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife.</span>
                
                <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span>
                
                <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</span>
                
                <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</span>
                
                <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us to peace.</span>
                
                <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?</span>
                
                <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</span>
                
                <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span>
                
                <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span>
                
                <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</span>
                
                <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.</span>
                
                <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.</span>
                
                <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</span>
                
                <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</span>
                
                <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span>
                
                <span id="7v26">(<a href="#7v26">26)</a> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.</span>
                
                <span id="7v27">(<a href="#7v27">27)</a> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span>
                
                <span id="7v28">(<a href="#7v28">28)</a> But and if thou marry, thou hast not cringed; and if a virgin marry, she hath not cringed. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</span>
                
                <span id="7v29">(<a href="#7v29">29)</a> But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</span>
                
                <span id="7v30">(<a href="#7v30">30)</a> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</span>
                
                <span id="7v31">(<a href="#7v31">31)</a> And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</span>
                
                <span id="7v32">(<a href="#7v32">32)</a> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span>
                
                <span id="7v33">(<a href="#7v33">33)</a> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.</span>
                
                <span id="7v34">(<a href="#7v34">34)</a> There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.</span>
                
                <span id="7v35">(<a href="#7v35">35)</a> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span>
                
                <span id="7v36">(<a href="#7v36">36)</a> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he cringeth not: let them marry.</span>
                
                <span id="7v37">(<a href="#7v37">37)</a> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</span>
                
                <span id="7v38">(<a href="#7v38">38)</a> So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.</span>
                
                <span id="7v39">(<a href="#7v39">39)</a> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="7v40">(<a href="#7v40">40)</a> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</span>

                <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</span>
                
                <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</span>
                
                <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</span>
                
                <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God but one.</span>
                
                <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)</span>
                
                <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.</span>
                
                <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> Howbeit [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span>
                
                <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</span>
                
                <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</span>
                
                <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</span>
                
                <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</span>
                
                <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> But when ye cringe so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye cringe against Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</span>

                <span id="9v1">(<a href="#9v1">1)</a> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</span>
                
                <span id="9v2">(<a href="#9v2">2)</a> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span>

                <span id="9v4">(<a href="#9v4">4)</a> Have we not power to eat and to drink?</span>

                <span id="9v6">(<a href="#9v6">6)</a> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</span>
                
                <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span>
                
                <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</span>
                
                <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</span>
                
                <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> Or saith he [it] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</span>
                
                <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span>
                
                <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</span>
                
                <span id="9v14">(<a href="#9v14">14)</a> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</span>
                
                <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span>
                
                <span id="9v16">(<a href="#9v16">16)</a> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</span>
                
                <span id="9v17">(<a href="#9v17">17)</a> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the gospel] is committed unto me.</span>
                
                <span id="9v18">(<a href="#9v18">18)</a> What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</span>
                
                <span id="9v19">(<a href="#9v19">19)</a> For though I be free from all [men], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</span>
                
                <span id="9v20">(<a href="#9v20">20)</a> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span>
                
                <span id="9v21">(<a href="#9v21">21)</a> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</span>
                
                <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.</span>
                
                <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you].</span>
                
                <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</span>
                
                <span id="9v25">(<a href="#9v25">25)</a> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span>
                
                <span id="9v26">(<a href="#9v26">26)</a> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</span>
                
                <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span>

                <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</span>

                <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</span>
                
                <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</span>
                
                <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</span>
                
                <span id="11v20">(<a href="#11v20">20)</a> When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper.</span>
                
                <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</span>
                
                <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.</span>
                
                <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:</span>
                
                <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span>
                
                <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.</span>
                
                <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</span>
                
                <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.</span>
                
                <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</span>
                
                <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</span>

                <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</span>
                
                <span id="11v34">(<a href="#11v34">34)</a> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</span>

                <span id="12v4">(<a href="#12v4">4)</a> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span>

                <span id="12v13">(<a href="#12v13">13)</a> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="12v14">(<a href="#12v14">14)</a> For the body is not one member, but many.</span>

                <span id="12v22">(<a href="#12v22">22)</a> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</span>
                
                <span id="12v23">(<a href="#12v23">23)</a> And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.</span>
                
                <span id="12v24">(<a href="#12v24">24)</a> For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:</span>
                
                <span id="12v25">(<a href="#12v25">25)</a> That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</span>

                <span id="14v10">(<a href="#14v10">10)</a> There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.</span>

                <span id="15v1">(<a href="#15v1">1)</a> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</span>
                
                <span id="15v2">(<a href="#15v2">2)</a> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</span>
                
                <span id="15v3">(<a href="#15v3">3)</a> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our cringes according to the scriptures;</span>
                
                <span id="15v4">(<a href="#15v4">4)</a> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</span>
                
                <span id="15v5">(<a href="#15v5">5)</a> And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</span>
                
                <span id="15v6">(<a href="#15v6">6)</a> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</span>
                
                <span id="15v7">(<a href="#15v7">7)</a> After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</span>
                
                <span id="15v8">(<a href="#15v8">8)</a> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</span>
                
                <span id="15v9">(<a href="#15v9">9)</a> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span>
                
                <span id="15v10">(<a href="#15v10">10)</a> But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</span>
                
                <span id="15v11">(<a href="#15v11">11)</a> Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</span>
                
                <span id="15v12">(<a href="#15v12">12)</a> Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span>

                <span id="15v14">(<a href="#15v14">14)</a> And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.</span>
                
                <span id="15v15">(<a href="#15v15">15)</a> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</span>
                
                <span id="15v16">(<a href="#15v16">16)</a> For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</span>

                <span id="15v18">(<a href="#15v18">18)</a> Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</span>
                
                <span id="15v19">(<a href="#15v19">19)</a> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</span>

                <span id="15v25">(<a href="#15v25">25)</a> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</span>

                <span id="15v28">(<a href="#15v28">28)</a> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span>
                
                <span id="15v29">(<a href="#15v29">29)</a> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</span>
                
                <span id="15v30">(<a href="#15v30">30)</a> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</span>

                <span id="15v32">(<a href="#15v32">32)</a> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</span>
                
                <span id="15v33">(<a href="#15v33">33)</a> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span>

                <span id="15v35">(<a href="#15v35">35)</a> But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</span>
                
                <span id="15v36">(<a href="#15v36">36)</a> [Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</span>
                
                <span id="15v37">(<a href="#15v37">37)</a> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:</span>
                
                <span id="15v38">(<a href="#15v38">38)</a> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</span>
                
                <span id="15v39">(<a href="#15v39">39)</a> All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.</span>
                
                <span id="15v40">(<a href="#15v40">40)</a> [There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another.</span>
                
                <span id="15v41">(<a href="#15v41">41)</a> [There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for [one] star differeth from [another] star in glory.</span>
                
                <span id="15v42">(<a href="#15v42">42)</a> So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span>
                
                <span id="15v43">(<a href="#15v43">43)</a> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span>
                
                <span id="15v44">(<a href="#15v44">44)</a> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span>
                
                <span id="15v45">(<a href="#15v45">45)</a> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.</span>
                
                <span id="15v46">(<a href="#15v46">46)</a> Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</span>
                
                <span id="15v47">(<a href="#15v47">47)</a> The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.</span>

                <span id="15v49">(<a href="#15v49">49)</a> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span>
                
                <span id="15v50">(<a href="#15v50">50)</a> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span>

                <span id="15v53">(<a href="#15v53">53)</a> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.</span>
                
                <span id="15v54">(<a href="#15v54">54)</a> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span>
                
                <span id="15v55">(<a href="#15v55">55)</a> O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?</span>
