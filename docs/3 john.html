                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth [them] out of the church.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Demetrius hath good report of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, and we [also] bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] to thee. [Our] friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</span>
