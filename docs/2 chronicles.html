                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that [was] at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to [the place which] David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which [was] at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, [that is so] great?</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Wisdom and knowledge [is] granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that [have been] before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Then Solomon came [from his journey] to the high place that [was] at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem [as plenteous] as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that [are] in the vale for abundance.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out [horses] for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, [even so deal with me].</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate [it] to him, [and] to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This [is an ordinance] for ever to Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And the house which I build [is] great: for great [is] our God above all gods.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who [am] I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that [are] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants [shall be] with thy servants,</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build [shall be] wonderful great.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Huram said moreover, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And Solomon numbered all the strangers that [were] in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And he set threescore and ten thousand of them [to be] bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand [to be] hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            
            <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where [the LORD] appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</span>
                
                <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house], the length [of it was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height [was] an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</span>
                
                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold [was] gold of Parvaim.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</span>
                
                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> And he made the most holy house, the length whereof [was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And the wings of the cherubims [were] twenty cubits long: one wing [of the one cherub was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> And [one] wing of the other cherub [was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was] five cubits [also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And he made the vail [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits.</span>
                
                <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put [them] on the chains.</span>
                
                <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</span>
                
                <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> And under it [was] the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen [were] cast, when it was cast.</span>
                
                <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.</span>
                
                <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> And the thickness of it [was] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received and held three thousand baths.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.</span>
                
                <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</span>
                
                <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> He made also ten tables, and placed [them] in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy [endureth] for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</span>
                
                <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</span>

                <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span>

                <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</span>

                <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye [me] to return answer to this people?</span>
                
                <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</span>
                
                <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?</span>
                
                <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father's loins.</span>
                
                <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</span>
                
                <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</span>
                
                <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</span>

                <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span>

                <span id="14v6">(<a href="#14v6">6)</a> And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</span>
                
                <span id="14v7">(<a href="#14v7">7)</a> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought [him], and he hath given us rest on every side.

                <span id="15v6">(<a href="#15v6">6)</a> And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</span>

                <span id="15v9">(<a href="#15v9">9)</a> And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God [was] with him.</span>

                <span id="18v4">(<a href="#18v4">4)</a> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</span>
                
                <span id="18v5">(<a href="#18v5">5)</a> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the king's hand.</span>
                
                <span id="18v6">(<a href="#18v6">6)</a> But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</span>
                
                <span id="18v7">(<a href="#18v7">7)</a> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same [is] Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span>
                
                <span id="18v8">(<a href="#18v8">8)</a> And the king of Israel called for one [of his] officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</span>
                
                <span id="18v9">(<a href="#18v9">9)</a> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in [their] robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span>
                
                <span id="18v10">(<a href="#18v10">10)</a> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</span>
                
                <span id="18v11">(<a href="#18v11">11)</a> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.</span>
                
                <span id="18v12">(<a href="#18v12">12)</a> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.</span>
                
                <span id="18v13">(<a href="#18v13">13)</a> And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</span>
                
                <span id="18v14">(<a href="#18v14">14)</a> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</span>
                
                <span id="18v15">(<a href="#18v15">15)</a> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</span>
                
                <span id="18v16">(<a href="#18v16">16)</a> Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return [therefore] every man to his house in peace.</span>
                
                <span id="18v17">(<a href="#18v17">17)</a> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee [that] he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</span>
                
                <span id="18v18">(<a href="#18v18">18)</a> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and [on] his left.</span>
                
                <span id="18v19">(<a href="#18v19">19)</a> And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</span>
                
                <span id="18v20">(<a href="#18v20">20)</a> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</span>
                
                <span id="18v21">(<a href="#18v21">21)</a> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And [the LORD] said, Thou shalt entice [him], and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do [even] so.</span>
                
                <span id="18v22">(<a href="#18v22">22)</a> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</span>
                
                <span id="18v23">(<a href="#18v23">23)</a> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span>
                
                <span id="18v24">(<a href="#18v24">24)</a> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span>
                
                <span id="18v25">(<a href="#18v25">25)</a> Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span>
                
                <span id="18v26">(<a href="#18v26">26)</a> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span>
                
                <span id="18v27">(<a href="#18v27">27)</a> And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, [then] hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</span>
                
                <span id="18v28">(<a href="#18v28">28)</a> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span>
                
                <span id="18v29">(<a href="#18v29">29)</a> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</span>
                
                <span id="18v30">(<a href="#18v30">30)</a> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that [were] with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="18v31">(<a href="#18v31">31)</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.</span>
                
                <span id="18v32">(<a href="#18v32">32)</a> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</span>
                
                <span id="18v33">(<a href="#18v33">33)</a> And a [certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span>
                
                <span id="18v34">(<a href="#18v34">34)</a> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed [himself] up in [his] chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</span>

                <span id="22v7">(<a href="#22v7">7)</a> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span>
                
                <span id="22v8">(<a href="#22v8">8)</a> And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</span>

                <span id="24v8">(<a href="#24v8">8)</a> And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="24v9">(<a href="#24v9">9)</a> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection [that] Moses the servant of God [laid] upon Israel in the wilderness.</span>
                
                <span id="24v10">(<a href="#24v10">10)</a> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</span>
                
                <span id="24v11">(<a href="#24v11">11)</a> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that [there was] much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</span>
                
                <span id="24v12">(<a href="#24v12">12)</a> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="24v13">(<a href="#24v13">13)</a> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</span>
                
                <span id="24v14">(<a href="#24v14">14)</a> And when they had finished [it], they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, [even] vessels to minister, and to offer [withal], and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

                <span id="24v15">(<a href="#24v15">15)</a> But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old [was he] when he died.</span>
                
                <span id="24v16">(<a href="#24v16">16)</a> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</span>
                
                <span id="24v17">(<a href="#24v17">17)</a> Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</span>
                
                <span id="24v18">(<a href="#24v18">18)</a> And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</span>
                
                <span id="24v19">(<a href="#24v19">19)</a> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</span>
                
                <span id="24v20">(<a href="#24v20">20)</a> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</span>
                
                <span id="24v21">(<a href="#24v21">21)</a> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="24v22">(<a href="#24v22">22)</a> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon [it], and require [it].</span>

                <span id="24v24">(<a href="#24v24">24)</a> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

                <span id="29v29">(<a href="#29v29">29)</a> And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</span>
                
                <span id="29v30">(<a href="#29v30">30)</a> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span>
                
                <span id="29v31">(<a href="#29v31">31)</a> Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</span>
                
                <span id="29v32">(<a href="#29v32">32)</a> And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, [and] two hundred lambs: all these [were] for a burnt offering to the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="29v33">(<a href="#29v33">33)</a> And the consecrated things [were] six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</span>
                
                <span id="29v34">(<a href="#29v34">34)</a> But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the [other] priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites [were] more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span>
                
                <span id="29v35">(<a href="#29v35">35)</a> And also the burnt offerings [were] in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for [every] burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</span>
                
                <span id="29v36">(<a href="#29v36">36)</a> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was [done] suddenly.</span>

                <span id="30v1">(<a href="#30v1">1)</a> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</span>
                
                <span id="30v2">(<a href="#30v2">2)</a> For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</span>
                
                <span id="30v3">(<a href="#30v3">3)</a> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="30v4">(<a href="#30v4">4)</a> And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</span>
                
                <span id="30v5">(<a href="#30v5">5)</a> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done [it] of a long [time in such sort] as it was written.</span>
                
                <span id="30v6">(<a href="#30v6">6)</a> So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span>
                
                <span id="30v7">(<a href="#30v7">7)</a> And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, [who] therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</span>
                
                <span id="30v8">(<a href="#30v8">8)</a> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers [were, but] yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</span>
                
                <span id="30v9">(<a href="#30v9">9)</a> For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children [shall find] compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] face from you, if ye return unto him.</span>
                
                <span id="30v10">(<a href="#30v10">10)</a> So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span>
                
                <span id="30v11">(<a href="#30v11">11)</a> Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="30v12">(<a href="#30v12">12)</a> Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</span>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                <span id="30v13">(<a href="#30v13">13)</a> And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</span>
                
                <span id="30v14">(<a href="#30v14">14)</a> And they arose and took away the altars that [were] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast [them] into the brook Kidron.</span>
                
                <span id="30v15">(<a href="#30v15">15)</a> Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="30v16">(<a href="#30v16">16)</a> And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] of the hand of the Levites.</span>
                
                <span id="30v17">(<a href="#30v17">17)</a> For [there were] many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one [that was] not clean, to sanctify [them] unto the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="30v18">(<a href="#30v18">18)</a> For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</span>
                
                <span id="30v19">(<a href="#30v19">19)</a> [That] prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span>
                
                <span id="30v20">(<a href="#30v20">20)</a> And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span>
                
                <span id="30v21">(<a href="#30v21">21)</a> And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="30v22">(<a href="#30v22">22)</a> And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</span>
                
                <span id="30v23">(<a href="#30v23">23)</a> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.</span>
                
                <span id="30v24">(<a href="#30v24">24)</a> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span>
                
                <span id="30v25">(<a href="#30v25">25)</a> And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span>
                
                <span id="30v26">(<a href="#30v26">26)</a> So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel [there was] not the like in Jerusalem.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="30v27">(<a href="#30v27">27)</a> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to his holy dwelling place, [even] unto heaven.</span>
                
            </p>

                <span id="31v1">(<a href="#31v1">1)</a> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</span>

                <span id="31v2">(<a href="#31v2">2)</a> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="31v3">(<a href="#31v3">3)</a> [He appointed] also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit], for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as [it is] written in the law of the LORD.</span>
                
                <span id="31v4">(<a href="#31v4">4)</a> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</span>

                <span id="31v5">(<a href="#31v5">5)</a> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all [things] brought they in abundantly.</span>
                
                <span id="31v6">(<a href="#31v6">6)</a> And [concerning] the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid [them] by heaps.</span>
                
                <span id="31v7">(<a href="#31v7">7)</a> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished [them] in the seventh month.</span>

                <span id="31v9">(<a href="#31v9">9)</a> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</span>
                
                <span id="31v10">(<a href="#31v10">10)</a> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left [is] this great store.</span>

                <span id="32v6">(<a href="#32v6">6)</a> And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</span>

                <span id="32v18">(<a href="#32v18">18)</a> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</span>
                
                <span id="32v19">(<a href="#32v19">19)</a> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, [which were] the work of the hands of man.</span>

                <span id="34v25">(<a href="#34v25">25)</a> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span>
                
                <span id="34v26">(<a href="#34v26">26)</a> And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel [concerning] the words which thou hast heard;</span>

                <span id="35v1">(<a href="#35v1">1)</a> Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.</span>

                <span id="35v3">(<a href="#35v3">3)</a> And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; [it shall] not [be] a burden upon [your] shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</span>
                
                <span id="35v4">(<a href="#35v4">4)</a> And prepare [yourselves] by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</span>
                
                <span id="35v5">(<a href="#35v5">5)</a> And stand in the holy [place] according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and [after] the division of the families of the Levites.</span>
                
                <span id="35v6">(<a href="#35v6">6)</a> So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that [they] may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</span>
                
                <span id="35v7">(<a href="#35v7">7)</a> And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these [were] of the king's substance.</span>
                
                <span id="35v8">(<a href="#35v8">8)</a> And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.</span>
                
                <span id="35v9">(<a href="#35v9">9)</a> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</span>
                
                <span id="35v10">(<a href="#35v10">10)</a> So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</span>
                
                <span id="35v11">(<a href="#35v11">11)</a> And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood] from their hands, and the Levites flayed [them].</span>
                
                <span id="35v12">(<a href="#35v12">12)</a> And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as [it is] written in the book of Moses. And so [did they] with the oxen.</span>
                
                <span id="35v13">(<a href="#35v13">13)</a> And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the [other] holy [offerings] sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided [them] speedily among all the people.</span>
                
                <span id="35v14">(<a href="#35v14">14)</a> And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span>
                
                <span id="35v15">(<a href="#35v15">15)</a> And the singers the sons of Asaph [were] in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters [waited] at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span>
                
                <span id="35v16">(<a href="#35v16">16)</a> So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</span>
                
                <span id="35v17">(<a href="#35v17">17)</a> And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span>
                
                <span id="35v18">(<a href="#35v18">18)</a> And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
                
                <span id="35v19">(<a href="#35v19">19)</a> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</span>

                <span id="35v20">(<a href="#35v20">20)</a> After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</span>
                
                <span id="35v21">(<a href="#35v21">21)</a> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I come] not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from [meddling with] God, who [is] with me, that he destroy thee not.</span>
                
                <span id="35v22">(<a href="#35v22">22)</a> Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span>
                
                <span id="35v23">(<a href="#35v23">23)</a> And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</span>
                
                <span id="35v24">(<a href="#35v24">24)</a> His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in [one of] the sepulchres of his fathers.
