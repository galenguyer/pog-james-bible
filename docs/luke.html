        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were [now] well stricken in years.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And when Zacharias saw [him], he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, [thou that art] highly favoured, the Lord [is] with thee: blessed [art] thou among women.</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</span>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</span>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</span>
            
            <span id="1v37">(<a href="#1v37">37)</a> For with God nothing shall be impossible.</span>
            
            <span id="1v38">(<a href="#1v38">38)</a> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span>
            
            <span id="1v39">(<a href="#1v39">39)</a> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</span>
            
            <span id="1v40">(<a href="#1v40">40)</a> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</span>
            
            <span id="1v41">(<a href="#1v41">41)</a> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</span>
            
            <span id="1v42">(<a href="#1v42">42)</a> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.</span>
            
            <span id="1v43">(<a href="#1v43">43)</a> And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span>
            
            <span id="1v44">(<a href="#1v44">44)</a> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span>
            
            <span id="1v45">(<a href="#1v45">45)</a> And blessed [is] she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="1v46">(<a href="#1v46">46)</a> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span>
            
            <span id="1v47">(<a href="#1v47">47)</a> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span>
            
            <span id="1v48">(<a href="#1v48">48)</a> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v49">(<a href="#1v49">49)</a> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy [is] his name.</span>
            
            <span id="1v50">(<a href="#1v50">50)</a> And his mercy [is] on them that fear him from generation to generation.</span>
            
            <span id="1v51">(<a href="#1v51">51)</a> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</span>
            
            <span id="1v52">(<a href="#1v52">52)</a> He hath put down the mighty from [their] seats, and exalted them of low degree.</span>
            
            <span id="1v53">(<a href="#1v53">53)</a> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</span>
            
            <span id="1v54">(<a href="#1v54">54)</a> He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of [his] mercy;</span>
            
            <span id="1v55">(<a href="#1v55">55)</a> As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</span>
            
            <span id="1v56">(<a href="#1v56">56)</a> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</span>
            
            <span id="1v57">(<a href="#1v57">57)</a> Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</span>
            
            <span id="1v58">(<a href="#1v58">58)</a> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</span>
            
            <span id="1v59">(<a href="#1v59">59)</a> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</span>
            
            <span id="1v60">(<a href="#1v60">60)</a> And his mother answered and said, Not [so]; but he shall be called John.</span>
            
            <span id="1v61">(<a href="#1v61">61)</a> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</span>
            
            <span id="1v62">(<a href="#1v62">62)</a> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</span>
            
            <span id="1v63">(<a href="#1v63">63)</a> And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</span>
            
            <span id="1v64">(<a href="#1v64">64)</a> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spake, and praised God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v65">(<a href="#1v65">65)</a> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</span>
            
            <span id="1v66">(<a href="#1v66">66)</a> And all they that heard [them] laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v67">(<a href="#1v67">67)</a> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="1v68">(<a href="#1v68">68)</a> Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</span>
            
            <span id="1v69">(<a href="#1v69">69)</a> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</span>
            
            <span id="1v70">(<a href="#1v70">70)</a> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</span>
            
            <span id="1v71">(<a href="#1v71">71)</a> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</span>
            
            <span id="1v72">(<a href="#1v72">72)</a> To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</span>
            
            <span id="1v73">(<a href="#1v73">73)</a> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</span>
            
            <span id="1v74">(<a href="#1v74">74)</a> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</span>
            
            <span id="1v75">(<a href="#1v75">75)</a> In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</span>
            
            <span id="1v76">(<a href="#1v76">76)</a> And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</span>
            
            <span id="1v77">(<a href="#1v77">77)</a> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their cringes,</span>
            
            <span id="1v78">(<a href="#1v78">78)</a> Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</span>
            
            <span id="1v79">(<a href="#1v79">79)</a> To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</span>
            
            <span id="1v80">(<a href="#1v80">80)</a> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> ([And] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And when they had seen [it], they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And all they that heard [it] wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> But Mary kept all these things, and pondered [them] in her heart.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present [him] to the Lord;</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</span>

            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name [was] Simeon; and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</span>

            <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</span>

            <span id="2v31">(<a href="#2v31">31)</a> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</span>
            
            <span id="2v32">(<a href="#2v32">32)</a> A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v33">(<a href="#2v33">33)</a> And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v34">(<a href="#2v34">34)</a> And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</span>
            
            <span id="2v35">(<a href="#2v35">35)</a> (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</span>
            
            <span id="2v36">(<a href="#2v36">36)</a> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</span>
            
            <span id="2v37">(<a href="#2v37">37)</a> And she [was] a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served [God] with fastings and prayers night and day.</span>
            
            <span id="2v38">(<a href="#2v38">38)</a> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="2v39">(<a href="#2v39">39)</a> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span>
            
            <span id="2v40">(<a href="#2v40">40)</a> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v41">(<a href="#2v41">41)</a> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</span>

            <span id="2v44">(<a href="#2v44">44)</a> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintance.</span>
            
            <span id="2v45">(<a href="#2v45">45)</a> And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v46">(<a href="#2v46">46)</a> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</span>
            
            <span id="2v47">(<a href="#2v47">47)</a> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</span>
            
            <span id="2v48">(<a href="#2v48">48)</a> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</span>
            
            <span id="2v49">(<a href="#2v49">49)</a> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</span>
            
            <span id="2v50">(<a href="#2v50">50)</a> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="2v51">(<a href="#2v51">51)</a> And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</span>
            
            <span id="2v52">(<a href="#2v52">52)</a> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</span>

            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of cringes;</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth;</span>

            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?</span>

            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> John answered, saying unto [them] all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.</span>

            <span id="4v31">(<a href="#4v31">31)</a> And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.</span>
            
            <span id="4v32">(<a href="#4v32">32)</a> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v33">(<a href="#4v33">33)</a> And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</span>
            
            <span id="4v34">(<a href="#4v34">34)</a> Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, [thou] Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v35">(<a href="#4v35">35)</a> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</span>
            
            <span id="4v36">(<a href="#4v36">36)</a> And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span>
            
            <span id="4v37">(<a href="#4v37">37)</a> And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v38">(<a href="#4v38">38)</a> And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.</span>
            
            <span id="4v39">(<a href="#4v39">39)</a> And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v40">(<a href="#4v40">40)</a> Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v41">(<a href="#4v41">41)</a> And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="4v42">(<a href="#4v42">42)</a> And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v43">(<a href="#4v43">43)</a> And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</span>
            
            <span id="4v44">(<a href="#4v44">44)</a> And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</span>

        <h3 id="5"><a href="#5">Chapter 5</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets.</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</span>
            
            <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> And so [was] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span>
            
            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span>
            
            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="5v15">(<a href="#5v15">15)</a> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v16">(<a href="#5v16">16)</a> And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</span>
            
            <span id="5v17">(<a href="#5v17">17)</a> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v18">(<a href="#5v18">18)</a> And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him.</span>
            
            <span id="5v19">(<a href="#5v19">19)</a> And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="5v20">(<a href="#5v20">20)</a> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy cringes are forgiven thee.</span>
            
            <span id="5v21">(<a href="#5v21">21)</a> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive cringes, but God alone?</span>
            
            <span id="5v22">(<a href="#5v22">22)</a> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</span>
            
            <span id="5v23">(<a href="#5v23">23)</a> Whether is easier, to say, Thy cringes be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span>
            
            <span id="5v24">(<a href="#5v24">24)</a> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive cringes, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</span>
            
            <span id="5v25">(<a href="#5v25">25)</a> And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</span>
            
            <span id="5v26">(<a href="#5v26">26)</a> And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v27">(<a href="#5v27">27)</a> And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</span>
            
            <span id="5v28">(<a href="#5v28">28)</a> And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</span>
            
            <span id="5v29">(<a href="#5v29">29)</a> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</span>
            
            <span id="5v30">(<a href="#5v30">30)</a> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and cringers?</span>
            
            <span id="5v31">(<a href="#5v31">31)</a> And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</span>
            
            <span id="5v32">(<a href="#5v32">32)</a> I came not to call the righteous, but cringers to repentance.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v33">(<a href="#5v33">33)</a> And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</span>
            
            <span id="5v34">(<a href="#5v34">34)</a> And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span>
            
            <span id="5v35">(<a href="#5v35">35)</a> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v36">(<a href="#5v36">36)</a> And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agreeth not with the old.</span>
            
            <span id="5v37">(<a href="#5v37">37)</a> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</span>
            
            <span id="5v38">(<a href="#5v38">38)</a> But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span>
            
            <span id="5v39">(<a href="#5v39">39)</a> No man also having drunk old [wine] straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</span>

            <span id="6v1">(<a href="#6v1">1)</a> And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing [them] in [their] hands.</span>
            
            <span id="6v2">(<a href="#6v2">2)</a> And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</span>
            
            <span id="6v3">(<a href="#6v3">3)</a> And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;</span>
            
            <span id="6v4">(<a href="#6v4">4)</a> How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</span>
            
            <span id="6v5">(<a href="#6v5">5)</a> And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span>
            
            <span id="6v6">(<a href="#6v6">6)</a> And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.</span>
            
            <span id="6v7">(<a href="#6v7">7)</a> And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</span>
            
            <span id="6v8">(<a href="#6v8">8)</a> But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.</span>
            
            <span id="6v9">(<a href="#6v9">9)</a> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it]?</span>
            
            <span id="6v10">(<a href="#6v10">10)</a> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</span>
            
            <span id="6v11">(<a href="#6v11">11)</a> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="6v12">(<a href="#6v12">12)</a> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</span>

            <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</span>
            
            <span id="7v2">(<a href="#7v2">2)</a> And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</span>
            
            <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</span>
            
            <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</span>
            
            <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</span>
            
            <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</span>
            
            <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</span>
            
            <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].</span>
            
            <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</span>

            <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</span>
            
            <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</span>
            
            <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</span>
            
            <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span>
            
            <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</span>
            
            <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</span>
            
            <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</span>
            
            <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span>
            
            <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</span>
            
            <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.</span>
            
            <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span>
            
            <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span>

            <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>
            
            <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</span>
            
            <span id="7v26">(<a href="#7v26">26)</a> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="7v27">(<a href="#7v27">27)</a> This is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>

            <span id="7v29">(<a href="#7v29">29)</a> And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</span>

            <span id="7v32">(<a href="#7v32">32)</a> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span>

            <span id="7v34">(<a href="#7v34">34)</a> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and cringers!</span>
            
            <span id="7v35">(<a href="#7v35">35)</a> But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span>

            <span id="7v36">(<a href="#7v36">36)</a> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.</span>
            
            <span id="7v37">(<a href="#7v37">37)</a> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a cringer, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</span>
            
            <span id="7v38">(<a href="#7v38">38)</a> And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.</span>
            
            <span id="7v39">(<a href="#7v39">39)</a> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a cringer.</span>
            
            <span id="7v40">(<a href="#7v40">40)</a> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</span>
            
            <span id="7v41">(<a href="#7v41">41)</a> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span>
            
            <span id="7v42">(<a href="#7v42">42)</a> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span>
            
            <span id="7v43">(<a href="#7v43">43)</a> Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</span>
            
            <span id="7v44">(<a href="#7v44">44)</a> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.</span>
            
            <span id="7v45">(<a href="#7v45">45)</a> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span>
            
            <span id="7v46">(<a href="#7v46">46)</a> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span>
            
            <span id="7v47">(<a href="#7v47">47)</a> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her cringes, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.</span>
            
            <span id="7v48">(<a href="#7v48">48)</a> And he said unto her, Thy cringes are forgiven.</span>
            
            <span id="7v49">(<a href="#7v49">49)</a> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth cringes also?</span>
            
            <span id="7v50">(<a href="#7v50">50)</a> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</span>
            
            <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</span>
            
            <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</span>
            
            <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</span>
            
            <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
            
            <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</span>
            
            <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</span>
            
            <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span>
            
            <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span>
            
            <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> They on the rock [are they], which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</span>
            
            <span id="8v14">(<a href="#8v14">14)</a> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</span>
            
            <span id="8v15">(<a href="#8v15">15)</a> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep [it], and bring forth fruit with patience.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v16">(<a href="#8v16">16)</a> No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth [it] under a bed; but setteth [it] on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</span>
            
            <span id="8v17">(<a href="#8v17">17)</a> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [any thing] hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</span>

            <span id="8v20">(<a href="#8v20">20)</a> And it was told him [by certain] which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</span>
            
            <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v22">(<a href="#8v22">22)</a> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</span>
            
            <span id="8v23">(<a href="#8v23">23)</a> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled [with water], and were in jeopardy.</span>
            
            <span id="8v24">(<a href="#8v24">24)</a> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span>
            
            <span id="8v25">(<a href="#8v25">25)</a> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v26">(<a href="#8v26">26)</a> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</span>
            
            <span id="8v27">(<a href="#8v27">27)</a> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.</span>
            
            <span id="8v28">(<a href="#8v28">28)</a> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</span>
            
            <span id="8v29">(<a href="#8v29">29)</a> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</span>
            
            <span id="8v30">(<a href="#8v30">30)</a> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</span>
            
            <span id="8v31">(<a href="#8v31">31)</a> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</span>
            
            <span id="8v32">(<a href="#8v32">32)</a> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</span>
            
            <span id="8v33">(<a href="#8v33">33)</a> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</span>
            
            <span id="8v34">(<a href="#8v34">34)</a> When they that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled, and went and told [it] in the city and in the country.</span>
            
            <span id="8v35">(<a href="#8v35">35)</a> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</span>
            
            <span id="8v36">(<a href="#8v36">36)</a> They also which saw [it] told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v37">(<a href="#8v37">37)</a> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</span>
            
            <span id="8v38">(<a href="#8v38">38)</a> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="8v39">(<a href="#8v39">39)</a> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="8v40">(<a href="#8v40">40)</a> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v41">(<a href="#8v41">41)</a> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</span>
            
            <span id="8v42">(<a href="#8v42">42)</a> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v43">(<a href="#8v43">43)</a> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</span>
            
            <span id="8v44">(<a href="#8v44">44)</a> Came behind [him], and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</span>
            
            <span id="8v45">(<a href="#8v45">45)</a> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press [thee], and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span>
            
            <span id="8v46">(<a href="#8v46">46)</a> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</span>
            
            <span id="8v47">(<a href="#8v47">47)</a> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</span>
            
            <span id="8v48">(<a href="#8v48">48)</a> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v49">(<a href="#8v49">49)</a> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</span>
            
            <span id="8v50">(<a href="#8v50">50)</a> But when Jesus heard [it], he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</span>
            
            <span id="8v51">(<a href="#8v51">51)</a> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</span>
            
            <span id="8v52">(<a href="#8v52">52)</a> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>
            
            <span id="8v53">(<a href="#8v53">53)</a> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</span>
            
            <span id="8v54">(<a href="#8v54">54)</a> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</span>
            
            <span id="8v55">(<a href="#8v55">55)</a> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</span>
            
            <span id="8v56">(<a href="#8v56">56)</a> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="9"><a href="#9">Chapter 9</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v1">(<a href="#9v1">1)</a> Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</span>
            
            <span id="9v2">(<a href="#9v2">2)</a> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</span>
            
            <span id="9v3">(<a href="#9v3">3)</a> And he said unto them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.</span>
            
            <span id="9v4">(<a href="#9v4">4)</a> And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.</span>
            
            <span id="9v5">(<a href="#9v5">5)</a> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</span>
            
            <span id="9v6">(<a href="#9v6">6)</a> And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</span>
            
            <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</span>
            
            <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</span>
            
            <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> And the people, when they knew [it], followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</span>
            
            <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</span>
            
            <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</span>
            
            <span id="9v14">(<a href="#9v14">14)</a> For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</span>
            
            <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span>
            
            <span id="9v16">(<a href="#9v16">16)</a> Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span>
            
            <span id="9v17">(<a href="#9v17">17)</a> And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v18">(<a href="#9v18">18)</a> And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</span>
            
            <span id="9v19">(<a href="#9v19">19)</a> They answering said, John the Baptist; but some [say], Elias; and others [say], that one of the old prophets is risen again.</span>
            
            <span id="9v20">(<a href="#9v20">20)</a> He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</span>
            
            <span id="9v21">(<a href="#9v21">21)</a> And he straitly charged them, and commanded [them] to tell no man that thing;</span>
            
            <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</span>
            
            <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</span>
            
            <span id="9v25">(<a href="#9v25">25)</a> For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</span>
            
            <span id="9v26">(<a href="#9v26">26)</a> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and [in his] Father's, and of the holy angels.</span>
            
            <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v28">(<a href="#9v28">28)</a> And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</span>
            
            <span id="9v29">(<a href="#9v29">29)</a> And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [was] white [and] glistering.</span>
            
            <span id="9v30">(<a href="#9v30">30)</a> And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</span>
            
            <span id="9v31">(<a href="#9v31">31)</a> Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="9v32">(<a href="#9v32">32)</a> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v33">(<a href="#9v33">33)</a> And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</span>
            
            <span id="9v34">(<a href="#9v34">34)</a> While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</span>
            
            <span id="9v35">(<a href="#9v35">35)</a> And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v36">(<a href="#9v36">36)</a> And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v37">(<a href="#9v37">37)</a> And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v38">(<a href="#9v38">38)</a> And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</span>
            
            <span id="9v39">(<a href="#9v39">39)</a> And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v40">(<a href="#9v40">40)</a> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</span>
            
            <span id="9v41">(<a href="#9v41">41)</a> And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</span>
            
            <span id="9v42">(<a href="#9v42">42)</a> And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare [him]. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v43">(<a href="#9v43">43)</a> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</span>
            
            <span id="9v44">(<a href="#9v44">44)</a> Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</span>
            
            <span id="9v45">(<a href="#9v45">45)</a> But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v46">(<a href="#9v46">46)</a> Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</span>
            
            <span id="9v47">(<a href="#9v47">47)</a> And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</span>
            
            <span id="9v48">(<a href="#9v48">48)</a> And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v49">(<a href="#9v49">49)</a> And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</span>
            
            <span id="9v50">(<a href="#9v50">50)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against us is for us.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v51">(<a href="#9v51">51)</a> And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span>
            
            <span id="9v52">(<a href="#9v52">52)</a> And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</span>
            
            <span id="9v53">(<a href="#9v53">53)</a> And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="9v54">(<a href="#9v54">54)</a> And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</span>
            
            <span id="9v55">(<a href="#9v55">55)</a> But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</span>
            
            <span id="9v56">(<a href="#9v56">56)</a> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save [them]. And they went to another village.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v57">(<a href="#9v57">57)</a> And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain [man] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span>
            
            <span id="9v58">(<a href="#9v58">58)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.</span>
            
            <span id="9v59">(<a href="#9v59">59)</a> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span>

            <span id="10v28">(<a href="#10v28">28)</a> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</span>

            <span id="10v33">(<a href="#10v33">33)</a> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion [on him],</span>
            
            <span id="10v34">(<a href="#10v34">34)</a> And went to [him], and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span>
            
            <span id="10v35">(<a href="#10v35">35)</a> And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave [them] to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</span>
            
            <span id="10v36">(<a href="#10v36">36)</a> Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</span>
            
            <span id="10v37">(<a href="#10v37">37)</a> And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</span>

            <span id="10v38">(<a href="#10v38">38)</a> Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</span>

            <span id="10v40">(<a href="#10v40">40)</a> But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</span>
            
            <span id="10v41">(<a href="#10v41">41)</a> And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</span>
            
            <span id="10v42">(<a href="#10v42">42)</a> But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</span>

            <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</span>
            
            <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</span>

            <span id="15v30">(<a href="#15v30">30)</a> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span>

            <span id="18v10">(<a href="#18v10">10)</a> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span>
            
            <span id="18v11">(<a href="#18v11">11)</a> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span>

            <span id="18v14">(<a href="#18v14">14)</a> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span>

            <span id="18v38">(<a href="#18v38">38)</a> And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
            
            <span id="18v39">(<a href="#18v39">39)</a> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</span>
            
            <span id="18v40">(<a href="#18v40">40)</a> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</span>
            
            <span id="18v41">(<a href="#18v41">41)</a> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span>
            
            <span id="18v42">(<a href="#18v42">42)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</span>
            
            <span id="18v43">(<a href="#18v43">43)</a> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="19v1">(<a href="#19v1">1)</a> And [Jesus] entered and passed through Jericho.</span>
            
            <span id="19v2">(<a href="#19v2">2)</a> And, behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</span>
            
            <span id="19v3">(<a href="#19v3">3)</a> And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</span>
            
            <span id="19v4">(<a href="#19v4">4)</a> And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that [way].</span>
            
            <span id="19v5">(<a href="#19v5">5)</a> And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</span>
            
            <span id="19v6">(<a href="#19v6">6)</a> And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</span>
            
            <span id="19v7">(<a href="#19v7">7)</a> And when they saw [it], they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a cringer.</span>
            
            <span id="19v8">(<a href="#19v8">8)</a> And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore [him] fourfold.</span>
            
            <span id="19v9">(<a href="#19v9">9)</a> And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="19v10">(<a href="#19v10">10)</a> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span>
            
            <span id="19v11">(<a href="#19v11">11)</a> And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</span>
            
            <span id="19v12">(<a href="#19v12">12)</a> He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span>
            
            <span id="19v13">(<a href="#19v13">13)</a> And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</span>
            
            <span id="19v14">(<a href="#19v14">14)</a> But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this [man] to reign over us.</span>
            
            <span id="19v15">(<a href="#19v15">15)</a> And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</span>
            
            <span id="19v16">(<a href="#19v16">16)</a> Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</span>
            
            <span id="19v17">(<a href="#19v17">17)</a> And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</span>
            
            <span id="19v18">(<a href="#19v18">18)</a> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</span>
            
            <span id="19v19">(<a href="#19v19">19)</a> And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</span>
            
            <span id="19v20">(<a href="#19v20">20)</a> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</span>
            
            <span id="19v21">(<a href="#19v21">21)</a> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</span>
            
            <span id="19v22">(<a href="#19v22">22)</a> And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, [thou] wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</span>
            
            <span id="19v23">(<a href="#19v23">23)</a> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</span>
            
            <span id="19v24">(<a href="#19v24">24)</a> And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give [it] to him that hath ten pounds.</span>
            
            <span id="19v25">(<a href="#19v25">25)</a> (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</span>
            
            <span id="19v26">(<a href="#19v26">26)</a> For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</span>
            
            <span id="19v27">(<a href="#19v27">27)</a> But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay [them] before me.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="19v28">(<a href="#19v28">28)</a> And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="19v29">(<a href="#19v29">29)</a> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span>
            
            <span id="19v30">(<a href="#19v30">30)</a> Saying, Go ye into the village over against [you]; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring [him hither].</span>
            
            <span id="19v31">(<a href="#19v31">31)</a> And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose [him]? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</span>
            
            <span id="19v32">(<a href="#19v32">32)</a> And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="19v33">(<a href="#19v33">33)</a> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</span>
            
            <span id="19v34">(<a href="#19v34">34)</a> And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</span>
            
            <span id="19v35">(<a href="#19v35">35)</a> And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</span>
            
            <span id="19v36">(<a href="#19v36">36)</a> And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span>
            
            <span id="19v37">(<a href="#19v37">37)</a> And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</span>
            
            <span id="19v38">(<a href="#19v38">38)</a> Saying, Blessed [be] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span>
            
            <span id="19v39">(<a href="#19v39">39)</a> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</span>
            
            <span id="19v40">(<a href="#19v40">40)</a> And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="19v41">(<a href="#19v41">41)</a> And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</span>
            
            <span id="19v42">(<a href="#19v42">42)</a> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things [which belong] unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</span>
            
            <span id="19v43">(<a href="#19v43">43)</a> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</span>
            
            <span id="19v44">(<a href="#19v44">44)</a> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span>
            
            <span id="19v45">(<a href="#19v45">45)</a> And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</span>
            
            <span id="19v46">(<a href="#19v46">46)</a> Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span>
            
            <span id="19v47">(<a href="#19v47">47)</a> And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</span>
            
            <span id="19v48">(<a href="#19v48">48)</a> And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span>

        <h3 id="20"><a href="#20">Chapter 20</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="20v1">(<a href="#20v1">1)</a> And it came to pass, [that] on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon [him] with the elders,</span>
            
            <span id="20v2">(<a href="#20v2">2)</a> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</span>
            
            <span id="20v3">(<a href="#20v3">3)</a> And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</span>
            
            <span id="20v4">(<a href="#20v4">4)</a> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</span>
            
            <span id="20v5">(<a href="#20v5">5)</a> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</span>
            
            <span id="20v6">(<a href="#20v6">6)</a> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</span>
            
            <span id="20v7">(<a href="#20v7">7)</a> And they answered, that they could not tell whence [it was].</span>
            
            <span id="20v8">(<a href="#20v8">8)</a> And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span>
            
            <span id="20v9">(<a href="#20v9">9)</a> Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</span>
            
            <span id="20v10">(<a href="#20v10">10)</a> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent [him] away empty.</span>
            
            <span id="20v11">(<a href="#20v11">11)</a> And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty.</span>
            
            <span id="20v12">(<a href="#20v12">12)</a> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast [him] out.</span>
            
            <span id="20v13">(<a href="#20v13">13)</a> Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence [him] when they see him.</span>
            
            <span id="20v14">(<a href="#20v14">14)</a> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our's.</span>
            
            <span id="20v15">(<a href="#20v15">15)</a> So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</span>
            
            <span id="20v16">(<a href="#20v16">16)</a> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it], they said, God forbid.</span>
            
            <span id="20v17">(<a href="#20v17">17)</a> And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</span>
            
            <span id="20v18">(<a href="#20v18">18)</a> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="20v19">(<a href="#20v19">19)</a> And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</span>
            
            <span id="20v20">(<a href="#20v20">20)</a> And they watched [him], and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</span>
            
            <span id="20v21">(<a href="#20v21">21)</a> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person [of any], but teachest the way of God truly:</span>
            
            <span id="20v22">(<a href="#20v22">22)</a> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</span>
            
            <span id="20v23">(<a href="#20v23">23)</a> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</span>
            
            <span id="20v24">(<a href="#20v24">24)</a> Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</span>
            
            <span id="20v25">(<a href="#20v25">25)</a> And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</span>
            
            <span id="20v26">(<a href="#20v26">26)</a> And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="20v27">(<a href="#20v27">27)</a> Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</span>
            
            <span id="20v28">(<a href="#20v28">28)</a> Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span>
            
            <span id="20v29">(<a href="#20v29">29)</a> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</span>
            
            <span id="20v30">(<a href="#20v30">30)</a> And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</span>
            
            <span id="20v31">(<a href="#20v31">31)</a> And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</span>
            
            <span id="20v32">(<a href="#20v32">32)</a> Last of all the woman died also.</span>
            
            <span id="20v33">(<a href="#20v33">33)</a> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="20v34">(<a href="#20v34">34)</a> And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</span>
            
            <span id="20v35">(<a href="#20v35">35)</a> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</span>
            
            <span id="20v36">(<a href="#20v36">36)</a> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</span>
            
            <span id="20v37">(<a href="#20v37">37)</a> Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span>
            
            <span id="20v38">(<a href="#20v38">38)</a> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="20v39">(<a href="#20v39">39)</a> Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</span>
            
            <span id="20v40">(<a href="#20v40">40)</a> And after that they durst not ask him any [question at all].</span>
            
            <span id="20v41">(<a href="#20v41">41)</a> And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?</span>

            <span id="22v52">(<a href="#22v52">52)</a> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</span>
            
            <span id="22v53">(<a href="#22v53">53)</a> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="22v54">(<a href="#22v54">54)</a> Then took they him, and led [him], and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</span>
            
            <span id="22v55">(<a href="#22v55">55)</a> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</span>
            
            <span id="22v56">(<a href="#22v56">56)</a> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</span>
            
            <span id="22v57">(<a href="#22v57">57)</a> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span>
            
            <span id="22v58">(<a href="#22v58">58)</a> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span>
            
            <span id="22v59">(<a href="#22v59">59)</a> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this [fellow] also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</span>
            
            <span id="22v60">(<a href="#22v60">60)</a> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</span>
            
            <span id="22v61">(<a href="#22v61">61)</a> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
            
            <span id="22v62">(<a href="#22v62">62)</a> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="22v63">(<a href="#22v63">63)</a> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote [him].</span>
            
            <span id="22v64">(<a href="#22v64">64)</a> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</span>
            
            <span id="22v65">(<a href="#22v65">65)</a> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="22v66">(<a href="#22v66">66)</a> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="22v67">(<a href="#22v67">67)</a> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</span>
            
            <span id="22v68">(<a href="#22v68">68)</a> And if I also ask [you], ye will not answer me, nor let [me] go.</span>
            
            <span id="22v69">(<a href="#22v69">69)</a> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span>
            
            <span id="22v70">(<a href="#22v70">70)</a> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</span>
            
            <span id="22v71">(<a href="#22v71">71)</a> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</span>

            <span id="23v1">(<a href="#23v1">1)</a> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</span>
            
            <span id="23v2">(<a href="#23v2">2)</a> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</span>
            
            <span id="23v3">(<a href="#23v3">3)</a> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].</span>
            
            <span id="23v4">(<a href="#23v4">4)</a> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.</span>
            
            <span id="23v5">(<a href="#23v5">5)</a> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</span>
            
            <span id="23v6">(<a href="#23v6">6)</a> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span>
            
            <span id="23v7">(<a href="#23v7">7)</a> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="23v8">(<a href="#23v8">8)</a> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</span>
            
            <span id="23v9">(<a href="#23v9">9)</a> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span>
            
            <span id="23v10">(<a href="#23v10">10)</a> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</span>
            
            <span id="23v11">(<a href="#23v11">11)</a> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="23v12">(<a href="#23v12">12)</a> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span>

            <span id="23v13">(<a href="#23v13">13)</a> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span>
            
            <span id="23v14">(<a href="#23v14">14)</a> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</span>
            
            <span id="23v15">(<a href="#23v15">15)</a> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="23v16">(<a href="#23v16">16)</a> I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].</span>
            
            <span id="23v17">(<a href="#23v17">17)</a> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</span>
            
            <span id="23v18">(<a href="#23v18">18)</a> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:</span>
            
            <span id="23v19">(<a href="#23v19">19)</a> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</span>
            
            <span id="23v20">(<a href="#23v20">20)</a> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</span>
            
            <span id="23v21">(<a href="#23v21">21)</a> But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.</span>
            
            <span id="23v22">(<a href="#23v22">22)</a> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.</span>
            
            <span id="23v23">(<a href="#23v23">23)</a> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</span>
            
            <span id="23v24">(<a href="#23v24">24)</a> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span>
            
            <span id="23v25">(<a href="#23v25">25)</a> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span>
            
            <span id="23v26">(<a href="#23v26">26)</a> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="23v27">(<a href="#23v27">27)</a> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</span>
            
            <span id="23v28">(<a href="#23v28">28)</a> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span>
            
            <span id="23v29">(<a href="#23v29">29)</a> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span>
            
            <span id="23v30">(<a href="#23v30">30)</a> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span>
            
            <span id="23v31">(<a href="#23v31">31)</a> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span>
            
            <span id="23v32">(<a href="#23v32">32)</a> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span>
            
            <span id="23v33">(<a href="#23v33">33)</a> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="23v34">(<a href="#23v34">34)</a> Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</span>
            
            <span id="23v35">(<a href="#23v35">35)</a> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</span>
            
            <span id="23v36">(<a href="#23v36">36)</a> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</span>
            
            <span id="23v37">(<a href="#23v37">37)</a> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span>
            
            <span id="23v38">(<a href="#23v38">38)</a> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="23v39">(<a href="#23v39">39)</a> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</span>
            
            <span id="23v40">(<a href="#23v40">40)</a> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span>
            
            <span id="23v41">(<a href="#23v41">41)</a> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</span>
            
            <span id="23v42">(<a href="#23v42">42)</a> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</span>
            
            <span id="23v43">(<a href="#23v43">43)</a> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span>
            
            <span id="23v44">(<a href="#23v44">44)</a> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</span>
            
            <span id="23v45">(<a href="#23v45">45)</a> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="23v46">(<a href="#23v46">46)</a> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</span>
            
            <span id="23v47">(<a href="#23v47">47)</a> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span>
            
            <span id="23v48">(<a href="#23v48">48)</a> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</span>
            
            <span id="23v49">(<a href="#23v49">49)</a> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</span>

            <span id="23v50">(<a href="#23v50">50)</a> And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counsellor; [and he was] a good man, and a just:</span>

            <span id="23v52">(<a href="#23v52">52)</a> This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span>
            
            <span id="23v53">(<a href="#23v53">53)</a> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</span>
            
            <span id="23v54">(<a href="#23v54">54)</a> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span>
            
            <span id="23v55">(<a href="#23v55">55)</a> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</span>
            
            <span id="23v56">(<a href="#23v56">56)</a> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</span>

            <span id="24v2">(<a href="#24v2">2)</a> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</span>

            <span id="24v4">(<a href="#24v4">4)</a> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</span>

            <span id="24v6">(<a href="#24v6">6)</a> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span>
            
            <span id="24v7">(<a href="#24v7">7)</a> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span>

            <span id="24v9">(<a href="#24v9">9)</a> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</span>
            
            <span id="24v10">(<a href="#24v10">10)</a> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</span>

            <span id="24v19">(<a href="#24v19">19)</a> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span>
            
            <span id="24v20">(<a href="#24v20">20)</a> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span>
            
            <span id="24v21">(<a href="#24v21">21)</a> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</span>
            
            <span id="24v22">(<a href="#24v22">22)</a> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</span>
            
            <span id="24v23">(<a href="#24v23">23)</a> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</span>
            
            <span id="24v24">(<a href="#24v24">24)</a> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span>
            
            <span id="24v25">(<a href="#24v25">25)</a> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span>
            
            <span id="24v26">(<a href="#24v26">26)</a> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span>
            
            <span id="24v27">(<a href="#24v27">27)</a> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span>
            
            <span id="24v28">(<a href="#24v28">28)</a> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</span>
            
            <span id="24v29">(<a href="#24v29">29)</a> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span>
            
            <span id="24v30">(<a href="#24v30">30)</a> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.</span>
            
            <span id="24v31">(<a href="#24v31">31)</a> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span>
            
            <span id="24v32">(<a href="#24v32">32)</a> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span>
            
            <span id="24v33">(<a href="#24v33">33)</a> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span>
            
            <span id="24v34">(<a href="#24v34">34)</a> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span>
            
            <span id="24v35">(<a href="#24v35">35)</a> And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="24v36">(<a href="#24v36">36)</a> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="24v37">(<a href="#24v37">37)</a> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span>
            
            <span id="24v38">(<a href="#24v38">38)</a> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span>
            
            <span id="24v39">(<a href="#24v39">39)</a> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span>
            
            <span id="24v40">(<a href="#24v40">40)</a> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.</span>
            
            <span id="24v41">(<a href="#24v41">41)</a> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</span>
            
            <span id="24v42">(<a href="#24v42">42)</a> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</span>
            
            <span id="24v43">(<a href="#24v43">43)</a> And he took [it], and did eat before them.</span>
            
            <span id="24v44">(<a href="#24v44">44)</a> And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.</span>
            
            <span id="24v45">(<a href="#24v45">45)</a> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</span>
            
            <span id="24v46">(<a href="#24v46">46)</a> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span>
            
            <span id="24v47">(<a href="#24v47">47)</a> And that repentance and remission of cringes should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="24v48">(<a href="#24v48">48)</a> And ye are witnesses of these things.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="24v49">(<a href="#24v49">49)</a> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="24v50">(<a href="#24v50">50)</a> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span>
            
            <span id="24v51">(<a href="#24v51">51)</a> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="24v52">(<a href="#24v52">52)</a> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span>
            
            <span id="24v53">(<a href="#24v53">53)</a> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span>
