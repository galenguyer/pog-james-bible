                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> (For the life was manifested, and we have seen [it], and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</span>

                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And he is the propitiation for our cringes: and not for our's only, but also for [the cringes of] the whole world.</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> I write unto you, little children, because your cringes are forgiven you for his name's sake.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also].</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> These [things] have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.</span>
                
                <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</span>
                
                <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span>
                
                <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</span>

                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</span>

                <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> He that committeth cringe is of the devil; for the devil cringeth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span>
                
                <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit cringe; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot cringe, because he is born of God.</span>
                
                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</span>
                
                <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span>
                
                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death.</span>
                
                <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span>

                <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span>
                
                <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</span>
