        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> In the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Also out of the midst thereof [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet [was] like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And [they had] the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Their wings [were] joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Thus [were] their faces: and their wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings] of every one [were] joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; [and] they turned not when they went.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals of fire, [and] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> When they went, they went upon their four sides: [and] they turned not when they went.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings [were] full of eyes round about them four.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither [was their] spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> When those went, [these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature [was] as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And under the firmament [were] their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> And there was a voice from the firmament that [was] over their heads, when they stood, [and] had let down their wings.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> And above the firmament that [was] over their heads [was] the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</span>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness round about. This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw [it], I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</span>

        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, [even] unto this very day.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> For [they are] impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns [be] with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they [are] most rebellious.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> And when I looked, behold, an hand [was] sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book [was] therein;</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> And he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat [it]; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> For thou [art] not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, [but] to the house of Israel;</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel [are] impudent and hardhearted.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> [I heard] also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> Again, When a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his cringe, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous [man], that the righteous cringe not, and he doth not cringe, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v27">(<a href="#3v27">27)</a> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, [even] Jerusalem:</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against it round about.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it [for] a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This [shall be] a sign to the house of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm [shall be] uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, [according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> And thy meat which thou shalt eat [shall be] by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</span>

            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> And thou shalt eat it [as] barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</span>

            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</span>

            <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</span>

            <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</span>

            <span id="23v7">(<a href="#23v7">7)</a> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them [that were] the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</span>
            
            <span id="23v8">(<a href="#23v8">8)</a> Neither left she her whoredoms [brought] from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</span>
            
            <span id="23v9">(<a href="#23v9">9)</a> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</span>

            <span id="23v24">(<a href="#23v24">24)</a> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, [which] shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</span>
            
            <span id="23v25">(<a href="#23v25">25)</a> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</span>
