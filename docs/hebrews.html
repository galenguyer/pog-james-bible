        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our cringes, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But unto the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the cringes of the people.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of cringe.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had cringed, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</span>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without cringe.</span>
            
            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="5"><a href="#5">Chapter 5</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for cringes:</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</span>
            
            <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</span>
            
            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</span>
            
            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</span>
            
            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="6"><a href="#6">Chapter 6</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="6v1">(<a href="#6v1">1)</a> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</span>
            
            <span id="6v2">(<a href="#6v2">2)</a> Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</span>
            
            <span id="6v3">(<a href="#6v3">3)</a> And this will we do, if God permit.</span>
            
            <span id="6v4">(<a href="#6v4">4)</a> For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</span>
            
            <span id="6v5">(<a href="#6v5">5)</a> And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</span>
            
            <span id="6v6">(<a href="#6v6">6)</a> If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.</span>
            
            <span id="6v7">(<a href="#6v7">7)</a> For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</span>
            
            <span id="6v8">(<a href="#6v8">8)</a> But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.</span>
            
            <span id="6v9">(<a href="#6v9">9)</a> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</span>
            
            <span id="6v10">(<a href="#6v10">10)</a> For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</span>
            
            <span id="6v11">(<a href="#6v11">11)</a> And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</span>
            
            <span id="6v12">(<a href="#6v12">12)</a> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</span>
            
            <span id="6v13">(<a href="#6v13">13)</a> For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</span>
            
            <span id="6v14">(<a href="#6v14">14)</a> Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</span>
            
            <span id="6v15">(<a href="#6v15">15)</a> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</span>
            
            <span id="6v16">(<a href="#6v16">16)</a> For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</span>
            
            <span id="6v17">(<a href="#6v17">17)</a> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:</span>
            
            <span id="6v18">(<a href="#6v18">18)</a> That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</span>
            
            <span id="6v19">(<a href="#6v19">19)</a> Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</span>
            
            <span id="6v20">(<a href="#6v20">20)</a> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span>

        <h3 id="7"><a href="#7">Chapter 7</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v1">(<a href="#7v1">1)</a> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</span>
            
            <span id="7v2">(<a href="#7v2">2)</a> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</span>
            
            <span id="7v3">(<a href="#7v3">3)</a> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span>
            
            <span id="7v4">(<a href="#7v4">4)</a> Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span>
            
            <span id="7v5">(<a href="#7v5">5)</a> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</span>
            
            <span id="7v6">(<a href="#7v6">6)</a> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</span>
            
            <span id="7v7">(<a href="#7v7">7)</a> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</span>
            
            <span id="7v8">(<a href="#7v8">8)</a> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</span>
            
            <span id="7v9">(<a href="#7v9">9)</a> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</span>
            
            <span id="7v10">(<a href="#7v10">10)</a> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</span>
            
            <span id="7v11">(<a href="#7v11">11)</a> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</span>
            
            <span id="7v12">(<a href="#7v12">12)</a> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</span>
            
            <span id="7v13">(<a href="#7v13">13)</a> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</span>
            
            <span id="7v14">(<a href="#7v14">14)</a> For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</span>
            
            <span id="7v15">(<a href="#7v15">15)</a> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</span>
            
            <span id="7v16">(<a href="#7v16">16)</a> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</span>
            
            <span id="7v17">(<a href="#7v17">17)</a> For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</span>
            
            <span id="7v18">(<a href="#7v18">18)</a> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="7v19">(<a href="#7v19">19)</a> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</span>
            
            <span id="7v20">(<a href="#7v20">20)</a> And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:</span>
            
            <span id="7v21">(<a href="#7v21">21)</a> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</span>
            
            <span id="7v22">(<a href="#7v22">22)</a> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</span>
            
            <span id="7v23">(<a href="#7v23">23)</a> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</span>
            
            <span id="7v24">(<a href="#7v24">24)</a> But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</span>
            
            <span id="7v25">(<a href="#7v25">25)</a> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span>
            
            <span id="7v26">(<a href="#7v26">26)</a> For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from cringers, and made higher than the heavens;</span>
            
            <span id="7v27">(<a href="#7v27">27)</a> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own cringes, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</span>
            
            <span id="7v28">(<a href="#7v28">28)</a> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="8"><a href="#8">Chapter 8</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</span>
            
            <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</span>
            
            <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</span>
            
            <span id="8v4">(<a href="#8v4">4)</a> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</span>
            
            <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</span>
            
            <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</span>
            
            <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</span>
            
            <span id="8v8">(<a href="#8v8">8)</a> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</span>
            
            <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</span>
            
            <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</span>
            
            <span id="8v11">(<a href="#8v11">11)</a> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</span>
            
            <span id="8v12">(<a href="#8v12">12)</a> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their cringes and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span>
            
            <span id="8v13">(<a href="#8v13">13)</a> In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="9"><a href="#9">Chapter 9</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="9v1">(<a href="#9v1">1)</a> Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</span>
            
            <span id="9v2">(<a href="#9v2">2)</a> For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</span>
            
            <span id="9v3">(<a href="#9v3">3)</a> And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</span>
            
            <span id="9v4">(<a href="#9v4">4)</a> Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</span>
            
            <span id="9v5">(<a href="#9v5">5)</a> And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</span>
            
            <span id="9v6">(<a href="#9v6">6)</a> Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].</span>
            
            <span id="9v7">(<a href="#9v7">7)</a> But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:</span>
            
            <span id="9v8">(<a href="#9v8">8)</a> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</span>
            
            <span id="9v9">(<a href="#9v9">9)</a> Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</span>
            
            <span id="9v10">(<a href="#9v10">10)</a> [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.</span>
            
            <span id="9v11">(<a href="#9v11">11)</a> But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</span>
            
            <span id="9v12">(<a href="#9v12">12)</a> Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].</span>
            
            <span id="9v13">(<a href="#9v13">13)</a> For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</span>
            
            <span id="9v14">(<a href="#9v14">14)</a> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</span>
            
            <span id="9v15">(<a href="#9v15">15)</a> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</span>
            
            <span id="9v16">(<a href="#9v16">16)</a> For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</span>
            
            <span id="9v17">(<a href="#9v17">17)</a> For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</span>
            
            <span id="9v18">(<a href="#9v18">18)</a> Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.</span>
            
            <span id="9v19">(<a href="#9v19">19)</a> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span>
            
            <span id="9v20">(<a href="#9v20">20)</a> Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</span>
            
            <span id="9v21">(<a href="#9v21">21)</a> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</span>
            
            <span id="9v22">(<a href="#9v22">22)</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span>
            
            <span id="9v23">(<a href="#9v23">23)</a> [It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span>
            
            <span id="9v24">(<a href="#9v24">24)</a> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</span>
            
            <span id="9v25">(<a href="#9v25">25)</a> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</span>
            
            <span id="9v26">(<a href="#9v26">26)</a> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away cringe by the sacrifice of himself.</span>
            
            <span id="9v27">(<a href="#9v27">27)</a> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</span>
            
            <span id="9v28">(<a href="#9v28">28)</a> So Christ was once offered to bear the cringes of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without cringe unto salvation.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="10"><a href="#10">Chapter 10</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="10v1">(<a href="#10v1">1)</a> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</span>
            
            <span id="10v2">(<a href="#10v2">2)</a> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="10v3">(<a href="#10v3">3)</a> But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of cringes every year.</span>
            
            <span id="10v4">(<a href="#10v4">4)</a> For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away cringes.</span>
            
            <span id="10v5">(<a href="#10v5">5)</a> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</span>
            
            <span id="10v6">(<a href="#10v6">6)</a> In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for cringe thou hast had no pleasure.</span>
            
            <span id="10v7">(<a href="#10v7">7)</a> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</span>
            
            <span id="10v8">(<a href="#10v8">8)</a> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for cringe thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;</span>
            
            <span id="10v9">(<a href="#10v9">9)</a> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</span>
            
            <span id="10v10">(<a href="#10v10">10)</a> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].</span>
            
            <span id="10v11">(<a href="#10v11">11)</a> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away cringes:</span>
            
            <span id="10v12">(<a href="#10v12">12)</a> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for cringes for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</span>
            
            <span id="10v13">(<a href="#10v13">13)</a> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</span>
            
            <span id="10v14">(<a href="#10v14">14)</a> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</span>
            
            <span id="10v15">(<a href="#10v15">15)</a> [Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</span>
            
            <span id="10v16">(<a href="#10v16">16)</a> This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</span>
            
            <span id="10v17">(<a href="#10v17">17)</a> And their cringes and iniquities will I remember no more.</span>
            
            <span id="10v18">(<a href="#10v18">18)</a> Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for cringe.</span>

            <span id="10v26">(<a href="#10v26">26)</a> For if we cringe wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for cringes,</span>
            
            <span id="10v27">(<a href="#10v27">27)</a> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</span>
            
            <span id="10v28">(<a href="#10v28">28)</a> He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</span>

            <span id="10v30">(<a href="#10v30">30)</a> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span>
            
            <span id="10v31">(<a href="#10v31">31)</a> [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span>

            <span id="10v33">(<a href="#10v33">33)</a> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</span>
            
            <span id="10v34">(<a href="#10v34">34)</a> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</span>
            
            <span id="10v35">(<a href="#10v35">35)</a> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</span>
            
            <span id="10v36">(<a href="#10v36">36)</a> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</span>
            
            <span id="10v37">(<a href="#10v37">37)</a> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</span>
            
            <span id="10v38">(<a href="#10v38">38)</a> Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</span>

            <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> For by it the elders obtained a good report.</span>
            
            <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</span>
            
            <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</span>
            
            <span id="11v5">(<a href="#11v5">5)</a> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</span>
            
            <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span>
            
            <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span>
            
            <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</span>
            
            <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</span>
            
            <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</span>
            
            <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span>

            <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</span>

            <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</span>

            <span id="11v21">(<a href="#11v21">21)</a> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.</span>
            
            <span id="11v22">(<a href="#11v22">22)</a> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span>
            
            <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span>
            
            <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</span>
            
            <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of cringe for a season;</span>
            
            <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</span>
            
            <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</span>
            
            <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span>
            
            <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</span>
            
            <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</span>
            
            <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</span>

            <span id="12v1">(<a href="#12v1">1)</a> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the cringe which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</span>
            
            <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span>
            
            <span id="12v3">(<a href="#12v3">3)</a> For consider him that endured such contradiction of cringers against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span>

            <span id="12v6">(<a href="#12v6">6)</a> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span>
            
            <span id="12v7">(<a href="#12v7">7)</a> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</span>
            
            <span id="12v8">(<a href="#12v8">8)</a> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</span>
            
            <span id="12v9">(<a href="#12v9">9)</a> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</span>
            
            <span id="12v10">(<a href="#12v10">10)</a> For they verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.</span>
            
            <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</span>

            <span id="13v14">(<a href="#13v14">14)</a> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</span>
            
            <span id="13v15">(<a href="#13v15">15)</a> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.</span>
            
            <span id="13v16">(<a href="#13v16">16)</a> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span>
            
            <span id="13v17">(<a href="#13v17">17)</a> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.</span>
            
            <span id="13v18">(<a href="#13v18">18)</a> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</span>
            
            <span id="13v19">(<a href="#13v19">19)</a> But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span>
            
            <span id="13v20">(<a href="#13v20">20)</a> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</span>
            
            <span id="13v21">(<a href="#13v21">21)</a> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
            
            <span id="13v22">(<a href="#13v22">22)</a> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</span>
            
            <span id="13v23">(<a href="#13v23">23)</a> Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span>
            
            <span id="13v24">(<a href="#13v24">24)</a> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</span>
