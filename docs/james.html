                <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</span>
                
                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span>
                
                <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.</span>
                
                <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</span>
                
                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span>
                
                <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span>
                
                <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</span>
                
                <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span>
                
                <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth cringe: and cringe, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</span>
                
                <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span>
                
                <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span>
                
                <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span>
                
                <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span>
                
                <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span>
                
                <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span>
                
                <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span>
                
                <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</span>
                
                <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span>
                
                <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span>
                
                <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.</span>
                
                <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span>

                <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.</span>
                
                <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</span>
                
                <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</span>
                
                <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span>
                
                <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</span>
                
                <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span>
                
                <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</span>
                
                <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span>
                
                <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit cringe, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</span>
                
                <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.</span>
                
                <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span>
                
                <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span>
                
                <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span>
                
                <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span>
                
                <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span>
                
                <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?</span>
                
                <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</span>
                
                <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span>
                
                <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span>
                
                <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span>
                
                <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span>
                
                <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span>
                
                <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span>
                
                <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span>
                
                <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?</span>
                
                <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span>

                <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</span>
                
                <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body.</span>
                
                <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</span>

                <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</span>
                
                <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</span>
                
                <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</span>

                <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span>

                <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</span>
                
                <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</span>
                
                <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</span>
