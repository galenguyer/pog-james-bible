                <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth among us, and shall be with us for ever.</span>
                
                <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span>
                
                <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span>
                
                <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span>
                
                <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</span>
                
                <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span>

                <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:</span>
                
                <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</span>
