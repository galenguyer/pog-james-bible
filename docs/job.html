        <h2>Job</h2>
        
        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And his sons went and feasted [in their] houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have cringed, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> In all this Job cringed not, nor charged God foolishly.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in thine hand; but save his life.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job cringe with his lips.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that [his] grief was very great.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="3"><a href="#3">Chapter 3</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> And Job spake, and said,</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> Which long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</span>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?</span>
            
            <span id="3v23">(<a href="#3v23">23)</a> [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</span>
            
            <span id="3v24">(<a href="#3v24">24)</a> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</span>
            
            <span id="3v25">(<a href="#3v25">25)</a> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="3v26">(<a href="#3v26">26)</a> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="4"><a href="#4">Chapter 4</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> [If] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> [Is] not [this] thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</span>
            
            <span id="4v12">(<a href="#4v12">12)</a> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</span>
            
            <span id="4v13">(<a href="#4v13">13)</a> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</span>
            
            <span id="4v14">(<a href="#4v14">14)</a> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</span>
            
            <span id="4v15">(<a href="#4v15">15)</a> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</span>
            
            <span id="4v16">(<a href="#4v16">16)</a> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</span>
            
            <span id="4v17">(<a href="#4v17">17)</a> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</span>
            
            <span id="4v18">(<a href="#4v18">18)</a> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</span>
            
            <span id="4v19">(<a href="#4v19">19)</a> How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?</span>
            
            <span id="4v20">(<a href="#4v20">20)</a> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding [it].</span>
            
            <span id="4v21">(<a href="#4v21">21)</a> Doth not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="5"><a href="#5">Chapter 5</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] any to deliver [them].</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</span>
            
            <span id="5v6">(<a href="#5v6">6)</a> Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</span>
            
            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</span>
            
            <span id="5v8">(<a href="#5v8">8)</a> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</span>
            
            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</span>
            
            <span id="5v10">(<a href="#5v10">10)</a> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</span>
            
            <span id="5v11">(<a href="#5v11">11)</a> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</span>
            
            <span id="5v12">(<a href="#5v12">12)</a> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise.</span>
            
            <span id="5v13">(<a href="#5v13">13)</a> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</span>
            
            <span id="5v14">(<a href="#5v14">14)</a> They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</span>

            <span id="41v20">(<a href="#41v20">20)</a> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron.</span>
            
            <span id="41v21">(<a href="#41v21">21)</a> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="41v22">(<a href="#41v22">22)</a> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</span>
            
            <span id="41v23">(<a href="#41v23">23)</a> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</span>
            
            <span id="41v24">(<a href="#41v24">24)</a> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether [millstone].</span>
            
            <span id="41v25">(<a href="#41v25">25)</a> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</span>
            
            <span id="41v26">(<a href="#41v26">26)</a> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</span>
            
            <span id="41v27">(<a href="#41v27">27)</a> He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.</span>
            
            <span id="41v28">(<a href="#41v28">28)</a> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</span>
            
            <span id="41v29">(<a href="#41v29">29)</a> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</span>
            
            <span id="41v30">(<a href="#41v30">30)</a> Sharp stones [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</span>

            <span id="41v32">(<a href="#41v32">32)</a> He maketh a path to shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary.</span>
            
            <span id="41v33">(<a href="#41v33">33)</a> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="42v1">(<a href="#42v1">1)</a> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</span>
            
            <span id="42v2">(<a href="#42v2">2)</a> I know that thou canst do every [thing], and [that] no thought can be withholden from thee.</span>
            
            <span id="42v3">(<a href="#42v3">3)</a> Who [is] he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</span>
            
            <span id="42v4">(<a href="#42v4">4)</a> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span>
            
            <span id="42v5">(<a href="#42v5">5)</a> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</span>
            
            <span id="42v6">(<a href="#42v6">6)</a> Wherefore I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="42v7">(<a href="#42v7">7)</a> And it was [so], that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me [the thing that is] right, as my servant Job [hath].</span>
            
            <span id="42v8">(<a href="#42v8">8)</a> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, in that ye have not spoken of me [the thing which is] right, like my servant Job.</span>
            
            <span id="42v9">(<a href="#42v9">9)</a> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite [and] Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</span>
            
            <span id="42v10">(<a href="#42v10">10)</a> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span>
            
            <span id="42v11">(<a href="#42v11">11)</a> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</span>
            
            <span id="42v12">(<a href="#42v12">12)</a> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span>
            
            <span id="42v13">(<a href="#42v13">13)</a> He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span>
            
            <span id="42v14">(<a href="#42v14">14)</a> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</span>
            
            <span id="42v15">(<a href="#42v15">15)</a> And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span>
            
            <span id="42v16">(<a href="#42v16">16)</a> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.</span>
            
            <span id="42v17">(<a href="#42v17">17)</a> So Job died, [being] old and full of days.</span>
