        <h3 id="1"><a href="#1">Chapter 1</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> Now king David was old [and] stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> And the damsel [was] very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also [was a] very goodly [man]; and [his mother] bare him after Absalom.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped [him].</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which [belonged] to David, were not with Adonijah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which [is] by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth [it] not?</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest [it] not:</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span>
            
            <span id="1v21">(<a href="#1v21">21)</a> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v22">(<a href="#1v22">22)</a> And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</span>
            
            <span id="1v23">(<a href="#1v23">23)</a> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span>
            
            <span id="1v24">(<a href="#1v24">24)</a> And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</span>
            
            <span id="1v25">(<a href="#1v25">25)</a> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v26">(<a href="#1v26">26)</a> But me, [even] me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</span>
            
            <span id="1v27">(<a href="#1v27">27)</a> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed [it] unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v28">(<a href="#1v28">28)</a> Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</span>
            
            <span id="1v29">(<a href="#1v29">29)</a> And the king sware, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span>
            
            <span id="1v30">(<a href="#1v30">30)</a> Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</span>
            
            <span id="1v31">(<a href="#1v31">31)</a> Then Bath-sheba bowed with [her] face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v32">(<a href="#1v32">32)</a> And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span>
            
            <span id="1v33">(<a href="#1v33">33)</a> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</span>
            
            <span id="1v34">(<a href="#1v34">34)</a> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</span>
            
            <span id="1v35">(<a href="#1v35">35)</a> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</span>
            
            <span id="1v36">(<a href="#1v36">36)</a> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so [too].</span>
            
            <span id="1v37">(<a href="#1v37">37)</a> As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</span>
            
            <span id="1v38">(<a href="#1v38">38)</a> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span>
            
            <span id="1v39">(<a href="#1v39">39)</a> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</span>
            
            <span id="1v40">(<a href="#1v40">40)</a> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v41">(<a href="#1v41">41)</a> And Adonijah and all the guests that [were] with him heard [it] as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore [is this] noise of the city being in an uproar?</span>
            
            <span id="1v42">(<a href="#1v42">42)</a> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou [art] a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</span>
            
            <span id="1v43">(<a href="#1v43">43)</a> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</span>
            
            <span id="1v44">(<a href="#1v44">44)</a> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:</span>
            
            <span id="1v45">(<a href="#1v45">45)</a> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This [is] the noise that ye have heard.</span>
            
            <span id="1v46">(<a href="#1v46">46)</a> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</span>
            
            <span id="1v47">(<a href="#1v47">47)</a> And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</span>
            
            <span id="1v48">(<a href="#1v48">48)</a> And also thus said the king, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, which hath given [one] to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing [it].</span>
            
            <span id="1v49">(<a href="#1v49">49)</a> And all the guests that [were] with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="1v50">(<a href="#1v50">50)</a> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span>
            
            <span id="1v51">(<a href="#1v51">51)</a> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</span>
            
            <span id="1v52">(<a href="#1v52">52)</a> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</span>
            
            <span id="1v53">(<a href="#1v53">53)</a> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 id="2"><a href="#2">Chapter 2</a></h3>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that [was] about his loins, and in his shoes that [were] on his feet.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And, behold, [thou hast] with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou [art] a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> And the days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and [that] all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; [I pray thee], say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he [is] mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</span>
            
            <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> Now therefore, [as] the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</span>
            
            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span>
            
            <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span>
            
            <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, [he is] by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</span>
            
            <span id="2v30">(<a href="#2v30">30)</a> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span>
            
            <span id="2v31">(<a href="#2v31">31)</a> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</span>
            
            <span id="2v32">(<a href="#2v32">32)</a> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing [thereof, to wit], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span>
            
            <span id="2v33">(<a href="#2v33">33)</a> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="2v34">(<a href="#2v34">34)</a> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span>

            <span id="2v40">(<a href="#2v40">40)</a> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span>
            
            <span id="2v41">(<a href="#2v41">41)</a> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</span>

            <span id="2v43">(<a href="#2v43">43)</a> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</span>
            
            <span id="2v44">(<a href="#2v44">44)</a> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</span>
            
            <span id="2v45">(<a href="#2v45">45)</a> And king Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</span>

            <span id="7v34">(<a href="#7v34">34)</a> And [there were] four undersetters to the four corners of one base: [and] the undersetters [were] of the very base itself.</span>
            
            <span id="7v35">(<a href="#7v35">35)</a> And in the top of the base [was there] a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof [were] of the same.</span>
            
            <span id="7v36">(<a href="#7v36">36)</a> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</span>
            
            <span id="7v37">(<a href="#7v37">37)</a> After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, [and] one size.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="7v38">(<a href="#7v38">38)</a> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: [and] every laver was four cubits: [and] upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</span>
            
            <span id="7v39">(<a href="#7v39">39)</a> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="7v40">(<a href="#7v40">40)</a> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</span>
            
            <span id="7v41">(<a href="#7v41">41)</a> The two pillars, and the [two] bowls of the chapiters that [were] on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which [were] upon the top of the pillars;</span>
            
            <span id="7v42">(<a href="#7v42">42)</a> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, [even] two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that [were] upon the pillars;</span>
            
            <span id="7v43">(<a href="#7v43">43)</a> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</span>
            
            <span id="7v44">(<a href="#7v44">44)</a> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</span>
            
            <span id="7v45">(<a href="#7v45">45)</a> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, [were of] bright brass.</span>
            
            <span id="7v46">(<a href="#7v46">46)</a> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</span>
            
            <span id="7v47">(<a href="#7v47">47)</a> And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</span>
            
            <span id="7v48">(<a href="#7v48">48)</a> And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread [was],</span>
            
            <span id="7v49">(<a href="#7v49">49)</a> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right [side], and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs [of] gold,</span>
            
            <span id="7v50">(<a href="#7v50">50)</a> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers [of] pure gold; and the hinges [of] gold, [both] for the doors of the inner house, the most holy [place, and] for the doors of the house, [to wit], of the temple.</span>
            
            <span id="7v51">(<a href="#7v51">51)</a> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</span>

            <span id="8v1">(<a href="#8v1">1)</a> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion.</span>
            
            <span id="8v2">(<a href="#8v2">2)</a> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which [is] the seventh month.</span>
            
            <span id="8v3">(<a href="#8v3">3)</a> And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</span>

            <span id="8v5">(<a href="#8v5">5)</a> And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, [were] with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</span>
            
            <span id="8v6">(<a href="#8v6">6)</a> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy [place, even] under the wings of the cherubims.</span>
            
            <span id="8v7">(<a href="#8v7">7)</a> For the cherubims spread forth [their] two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</span>

            <span id="8v9">(<a href="#8v9">9)</a> [There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span>
            
            <span id="8v10">(<a href="#8v10">10)</a> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy [place], that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</span>

            <span id="8v16">(<a href="#8v16">16)</a> Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="8v17">(<a href="#8v17">17)</a> And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</span>

            <span id="8v21">(<a href="#8v21">21)</a> And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein [is] the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</span>

            <span id="8v22">(<a href="#8v22">22)</a> And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:</span>

            <span id="11v23">(<a href="#11v23">23)</a> And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</span>
            
            <span id="11v24">(<a href="#11v24">24)</a> And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span>
            
            <span id="11v25">(<a href="#11v25">25)</a> And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span>

            <span id="11v26">(<a href="#11v26">26)</a> And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up [his] hand against the king.</span>
            
            <span id="11v27">(<a href="#11v27">27)</a> And this [was] the cause that he lifted up [his] hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, [and] repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</span>
            
            <span id="11v28">(<a href="#11v28">28)</a> And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span>
            
            <span id="11v29">(<a href="#11v29">29)</a> And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two [were] alone in the field:</span>
            
            <span id="11v30">(<a href="#11v30">30)</a> And Ahijah caught the new garment that [was] on him, and rent it [in] twelve pieces:</span>
            
            <span id="11v31">(<a href="#11v31">31)</a> And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</span>
            
            <span id="11v32">(<a href="#11v32">32)</a> (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)</span>
            
            <span id="11v33">(<a href="#11v33">33)</a> Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do [that which is] right in mine eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my judgments, as [did] David his father.</span>
            
            <span id="11v34">(<a href="#11v34">34)</a> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</span>
            
            <span id="11v35">(<a href="#11v35">35)</a> But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, [even] ten tribes.</span>
            
            <span id="11v36">(<a href="#11v36">36)</a> And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span>

            <span id="11v39">(<a href="#11v39">39)</a> And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</span>

            <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard [of it], (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</span>
            
            <span id="12v3">(<a href="#12v3">3)</a> That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="12v4">(<a href="#12v4">4)</a> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</span>
            
            <span id="12v5">(<a href="#12v5">5)</a> And he said unto them, Depart yet [for] three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="12v6">(<a href="#12v6">6)</a> And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</span>
            
            <span id="12v7">(<a href="#12v7">7)</a> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</span>
            
            <span id="12v8">(<a href="#12v8">8)</a> But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, [and] which stood before him:</span>
            
            <span id="12v9">(<a href="#12v9">9)</a> And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</span>
            
            <span id="12v10">(<a href="#12v10">10)</a> And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father's loins.</span>
            
            <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v12">(<a href="#12v12">12)</a> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</span>
            
            <span id="12v13">(<a href="#12v13">13)</a> And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;</span>
            
            <span id="12v14">(<a href="#12v14">14)</a> And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father [also] chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</span>
            
            <span id="12v15">(<a href="#12v15">15)</a> Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v16">(<a href="#12v16">16)</a> So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither [have we] inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</span>
            
            <span id="12v17">(<a href="#12v17">17)</a> But [as for] the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span>
            
            <span id="12v18">(<a href="#12v18">18)</a> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who [was] over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span>
            
            <span id="12v19">(<a href="#12v19">19)</a> So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</span>
            
            <span id="12v20">(<a href="#12v20">20)</a> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v21">(<a href="#12v21">21)</a> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</span>
            
            <span id="12v22">(<a href="#12v22">22)</a> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="12v23">(<a href="#12v23">23)</a> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="12v24">(<a href="#12v24">24)</a> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="12v25">(<a href="#12v25">25)</a> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</span>
            
            <span id="12v26">(<a href="#12v26">26)</a> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</span>
            
            <span id="12v27">(<a href="#12v27">27)</a> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, [even] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</span>
            
            <span id="12v28">(<a href="#12v28">28)</a> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span>
            
            <span id="12v29">(<a href="#12v29">29)</a> And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.</span>
            
            <span id="12v30">(<a href="#12v30">30)</a> And this thing became a cringe: for the people went [to worship] before the one, [even] unto Dan.</span>
            
            <span id="12v31">(<a href="#12v31">31)</a> And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</span>
            
            <span id="12v32">(<a href="#12v32">32)</a> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that [is] in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.</span>
            
            <span id="12v33">(<a href="#12v33">33)</a> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, [even] in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</span>

            <span id="13v1">(<a href="#13v1">1)</a> And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</span>
            
            <span id="13v2">(<a href="#13v2">2)</a> And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.</span>
            
            <span id="13v3">(<a href="#13v3">3)</a> And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that [are] upon it shall be poured out.</span>
            
            <span id="13v4">(<a href="#13v4">4)</a> And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.

            <span id="13v5">(<a href="#13v5">5)</a> The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="13v6">(<a href="#13v6">6)</a> And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as [it was] before.</span>
            
            <span id="13v7">(<a href="#13v7">7)</a> And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</span>
            
            <span id="13v8">(<a href="#13v8">8)</a> And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:</span>
            
            <span id="13v9">(<a href="#13v9">9)</a> For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</span>
            
            <span id="13v10">(<a href="#13v10">10)</a> So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="13v11">(<a href="#13v11">11)</a> Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.</span>
            
            <span id="13v12">(<a href="#13v12">12)</a> And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</span>

            <span id="13v18">(<a href="#13v18">18)</a> He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied unto him.</span>
            
            <span id="13v19">(<a href="#13v19">19)</a> So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</span>

            <span id="13v22">(<a href="#13v22">22)</a> But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which [the LORD] did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span>

            <span id="13v23">(<a href="#13v23">23)</a> And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, [to wit], for the prophet whom he had brought back.</span>

            <span id="16v7">(<a href="#16v7">7)</a> And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.</span>

            <span id="16v10">(<a href="#16v10">10)</a> And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span>

            <span id="16v12">(<a href="#16v12">12)</a> Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</span>

            <span id="16v22">(<a href="#16v22">22)</a> But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</span>

            <span id="16v32">(<a href="#16v32">32)</a> And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</span>

            <span id="17v2">(<a href="#17v2">2)</a> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</span>

            <span id="17v5">(<a href="#17v5">5)</a> So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.</span>
            
            <span id="17v6">(<a href="#17v6">6)</a> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</span>
            
            <span id="17v7">(<a href="#17v7">7)</a> And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</span>

            <span id="17v8">(<a href="#17v8">8)</a> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="17v9">(<a href="#17v9">9)</a> Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which [belongeth] to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</span>
            
            <span id="17v10">(<a href="#17v10">10)</a> So he arose and went to Zarephath.

            <span id="17v11">(<a href="#17v11">11)</a> And as she was going to fetch [it], he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</span>
            
            <span id="17v12">(<a href="#17v12">12)</a> And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</span>
            
            <span id="17v13">(<a href="#17v13">13)</a> And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go [and] do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring [it] unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</span>
            
            <span id="17v14">(<a href="#17v14">14)</a> For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day [that] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="17v15">(<a href="#17v15">15)</a> And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat [many] days.</span>

            <span id="17v19">(<a href="#17v19">19)</a> And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</span>
            
            <span id="17v20">(<a href="#17v20">20)</a> And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</span>
            
            <span id="17v21">(<a href="#17v21">21)</a> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.</span>
            
            <span id="17v22">(<a href="#17v22">22)</a> And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span>
            
            <span id="17v23">(<a href="#17v23">23)</a> And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</span>

            <span id="18v1">(<a href="#18v1">1)</a> And it came to pass [after] many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="18v2">(<a href="#18v2">2)</a> And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And [there was] a sore famine in Samaria.</span>

            <span id="18v4">(<a href="#18v4">4)</a> For it was [so], when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</span>
            
            <span id="18v5">(<a href="#18v5">5)</a> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</span>
            
            <span id="18v6">(<a href="#18v6">6)</a> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</span>

            <span id="18v7">(<a href="#18v7">7)</a> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Art] thou that my lord Elijah?</span>
            
            <span id="18v8">(<a href="#18v8">8)</a> And he answered him, I [am]: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].</span>

            <span id="18v11">(<a href="#18v11">11)</a> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here].</span>

            <span id="18v13">(<a href="#18v13">13)</a> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span>
            
            <span id="18v14">(<a href="#18v14">14)</a> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here]: and he shall slay me.</span>

            <span id="18v19">(<a href="#18v19">19)</a> Now therefore send, [and] gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.</span>
            
            <span id="18v20">(<a href="#18v20">20)</a> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</span>

            <span id="18v23">(<a href="#18v23">23)</a> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under]: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under]:</span>
            
            <span id="18v24">(<a href="#18v24">24)</a> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</span>
            
            <span id="18v25">(<a href="#18v25">25)</a> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress [it] first; for ye [are] many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire [under].</span>
            
            <span id="18v26">(<a href="#18v26">26)</a> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</span>
            
            <span id="18v27">(<a href="#18v27">27)</a> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, [or] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</span>
            
            <span id="18v28">(<a href="#18v28">28)</a> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</span>
            
            <span id="18v29">(<a href="#18v29">29)</a> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the [time] of the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that [there was] neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</span>
            
            <span id="18v30">(<a href="#18v30">30)</a> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD [that was] broken down.</span>
            
            <span id="18v31">(<a href="#18v31">31)</a> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</span>
            
            <span id="18v32">(<a href="#18v32">32)</a> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</span>
            
            <span id="18v33">(<a href="#18v33">33)</a> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid [him] on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour [it] on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</span>
            
            <span id="18v34">(<a href="#18v34">34)</a> And he said, Do [it] the second time. And they did [it] the second time. And he said, Do [it] the third time. And they did [it] the third time.</span>
            
            <span id="18v35">(<a href="#18v35">35)</a> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</span>
            
            <span id="18v36">(<a href="#18v36">36)</a> And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou [art] God in Israel, and [that] I [am] thy servant, and [that] I have done all these things at thy word.</span>
            
            <span id="18v37">(<a href="#18v37">37)</a> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou [art] the LORD God, and [that] thou hast turned their heart back again.</span>
            
            <span id="18v38">(<a href="#18v38">38)</a> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that [was] in the trench.</span>
            
            <span id="18v39">(<a href="#18v39">39)</a> And when all the people saw [it], they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he [is] the God; the LORD, he [is] the God.</span>
            
            <span id="18v40">(<a href="#18v40">40)</a> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</span>
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            <span id="18v41">(<a href="#18v41">41)</a> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for [there is] a sound of abundance of rain.</span>
            
            <span id="18v42">(<a href="#18v42">42)</a> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</span>
            
            <span id="18v43">(<a href="#18v43">43)</a> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</span>
            
            <span id="18v44">(<a href="#18v44">44)</a> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare [thy chariot], and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</span>
            
            <span id="18v45">(<a href="#18v45">45)</a> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</span>
            
            <span id="18v46">(<a href="#18v46">46)</a> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</span>

            <span id="19v5">(<a href="#19v5">5)</a> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise [and] eat.</span>

            <span id="20v29">(<a href="#20v29">29)</a> And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And [so] it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</span>

            <span id="20v37">(<a href="#20v37">37)</a> Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded [him].</span>
            
            <span id="20v38">(<a href="#20v38">38)</a> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</span>
            
            <span id="20v39">(<a href="#20v39">39)</a> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</span>
            
            <span id="20v40">(<a href="#20v40">40)</a> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So [shall] thy judgment [be]; thyself hast decided [it].</span>
            
            <span id="20v41">(<a href="#20v41">41)</a> And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he [was] of the prophets.</span>
            
            <span id="20v42">(<a href="#20v42">42)</a> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of [thy] hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</span>
            
            <span id="20v43">(<a href="#20v43">43)</a> And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</span>

            <span id="21v1">(<a href="#21v1">1)</a> And it came to pass after these things, [that] Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which [was] in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</span>
            
            <span id="21v2">(<a href="#21v2">2)</a> And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it [is] near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; [or], if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</span>
            
            <span id="21v3">(<a href="#21v3">3)</a> And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</span>
            
            <span id="21v4">(<a href="#21v4">4)</a> And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.

        <p>
            
            <span id="21v5">(<a href="#21v5">5)</a> But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</span>
            
            <span id="21v6">(<a href="#21v6">6)</a> And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</span>
            
            <span id="21v7">(<a href="#21v7">7)</a> And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, [and] eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span>
            
            <span id="21v8">(<a href="#21v8">8)</a> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed [them] with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that [were] in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</span>
            
            <span id="21v9">(<a href="#21v9">9)</a> And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</span>

            <span id="21v11">(<a href="#21v11">11)</a> And the men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</span>
            
            <span id="21v12">(<a href="#21v12">12)</a> They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span>
            
            <span id="21v13">(<a href="#21v13">13)</a> And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, [even] against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.

            <span id="21v14">(<a href="#21v14">14)</a> Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span>

            <span id="21v16">(<a href="#21v16">16)</a> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span>

            <span id="21v19">(<a href="#21v19">19)</a> And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?

            <span id="21v20">(<a href="#21v20">20)</a> And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found [thee]: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</span>
            
            <span id="21v21">(<a href="#21v21">21)</a> Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</span>
            
            <span id="21v22">(<a href="#21v22">22)</a> And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked [me] to anger, and made Israel to cringe.</span>
            
            <span id="21v23">(<a href="#21v23">23)</a> And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</span>

            <span id="21v25">(<a href="#21v25">25)</a> But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span>

            <span id="21v27">(<a href="#21v27">27)</a> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span>
            
            <span id="21v28">(<a href="#21v28">28)</a> And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span>

            <span id="22v4">(<a href="#22v4">4)</a> And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</span>
            
            <span id="22v5">(<a href="#22v5">5)</a> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</span>
            
            <span id="22v6">(<a href="#22v6">6)</a> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

            <span id="22v7">(<a href="#22v7">7)</a> And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</span>
            
            <span id="22v8">(<a href="#22v8">8)</a> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span>
            
            <span id="22v9">(<a href="#22v9">9)</a> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten [hither] Micaiah the son of Imlah.</span>

            <span id="22v11">(<a href="#22v11">11)</a> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</span>
            
            <span id="22v12">(<a href="#22v12">12)</a> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the king's hand.</span>
            
            <span id="22v13">(<a href="#22v13">13)</a> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is] good.</span>
            
            <span id="22v14">(<a href="#22v14">14)</a> And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</span>

            <span id="22v16">(<a href="#22v16">16)</a> And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but [that which is] true in the name of the LORD?</span>

            <span id="22v20">(<a href="#22v20">20)</a> And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</span>
            
            <span id="22v21">(<a href="#22v21">21)</a> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</span>
            
            <span id="22v22">(<a href="#22v22">22)</a> And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him], and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</span>
            
            <span id="22v23">(<a href="#22v23">23)</a> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</span>
            
            <span id="22v24">(<a href="#22v24">24)</a> But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</span>
            
            <span id="22v25">(<a href="#22v25">25)</a> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</span>
            
            <span id="22v26">(<a href="#22v26">26)</a> And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span>
            
            <span id="22v27">(<a href="#22v27">27)</a> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</span>
            
            <span id="22v28">(<a href="#22v28">28)</a> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</span>
            
            <span id="22v29">(<a href="#22v29">29)</a> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span>
            
            <span id="22v30">(<a href="#22v30">30)</a> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</span>
            
            <span id="22v31">(<a href="#22v31">31)</a> But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="22v32">(<a href="#22v32">32)</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it [is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</span>
            
            <span id="22v33">(<a href="#22v33">33)</a> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it [was] not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</span>
            
            <span id="22v34">(<a href="#22v34">34)</a> And a [certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span>
            
            <span id="22v35">(<a href="#22v35">35)</a> And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</span>
            
            <span id="22v36">(<a href="#22v36">36)</a> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="22v37">(<a href="#22v37">37)</a> So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</span>
            
            <span id="22v38">(<a href="#22v38">38)</a> And [one] washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.</span>
            
            <span id="22v39">(<a href="#22v39">39)</a> Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span>
            
            <span id="22v40">(<a href="#22v40">40)</a> So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="22v41">(<a href="#22v41">41)</a> And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span>
            
            <span id="22v42">(<a href="#22v42">42)</a> Jehoshaphat [was] thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span>
            
            <span id="22v43">(<a href="#22v43">43)</a> And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; [for] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</span>
            
            <span id="22v44">(<a href="#22v44">44)</a> And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span>
