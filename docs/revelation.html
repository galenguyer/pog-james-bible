            <span id="1v1">(<a href="#1v1">1)</a> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John:</span>
            
            <span id="1v2">(<a href="#1v2">2)</a> Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</span>
            
            <span id="1v3">(<a href="#1v3">3)</a> Blessed [is] he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time [is] at hand.</span>
            
            <span id="1v4">(<a href="#1v4">4)</a> John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</span>
            
            <span id="1v5">(<a href="#1v5">5)</a> And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our cringes in his own blood,</span>
            
            <span id="1v6">(<a href="#1v6">6)</a> And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span>
            
            <span id="1v7">(<a href="#1v7">7)</a> Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they [also] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</span>
            
            <span id="1v8">(<a href="#1v8">8)</a> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</span>
            
            <span id="1v9">(<a href="#1v9">9)</a> I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span>
            
            <span id="1v10">(<a href="#1v10">10)</a> I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</span>
            
            <span id="1v11">(<a href="#1v11">11)</a> Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</span>
            
            <span id="1v12">(<a href="#1v12">12)</a> And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</span>
            
            <span id="1v13">(<a href="#1v13">13)</a> And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</span>
            
            <span id="1v14">(<a href="#1v14">14)</a> His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire;</span>
            
            <span id="1v15">(<a href="#1v15">15)</a> And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</span>
            
            <span id="1v16">(<a href="#1v16">16)</a> And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength.</span>
            
            <span id="1v17">(<a href="#1v17">17)</a> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</span>
            
            <span id="1v18">(<a href="#1v18">18)</a> I [am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</span>
            
            <span id="1v19">(<a href="#1v19">19)</a> Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</span>
            
            <span id="1v20">(<a href="#1v20">20)</a> The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="2v1">(<a href="#2v1">1)</a> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</span>
            
            <span id="2v2">(<a href="#2v2">2)</a> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</span>
            
            <span id="2v3">(<a href="#2v3">3)</a> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</span>
            
            <span id="2v4">(<a href="#2v4">4)</a> Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span>
            
            <span id="2v5">(<a href="#2v5">5)</a> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span>
            
            <span id="2v6">(<a href="#2v6">6)</a> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span>
            
            <span id="2v7">(<a href="#2v7">7)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span>
            
            <span id="2v8">(<a href="#2v8">8)</a> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span>
            
            <span id="2v9">(<a href="#2v9">9)</a> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.</span>
            
            <span id="2v10">(<a href="#2v10">10)</a> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span>
            
            <span id="2v11">(<a href="#2v11">11)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span>
            
            <span id="2v12">(<a href="#2v12">12)</a> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span>
            
            <span id="2v13">(<a href="#2v13">13)</a> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is]: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span>
            
            <span id="2v14">(<a href="#2v14">14)</a> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span>
            
            <span id="2v15">(<a href="#2v15">15)</a> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span>
            
            <span id="2v16">(<a href="#2v16">16)</a> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="2v17">(<a href="#2v17">17)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it].</span>
            
            <span id="2v18">(<a href="#2v18">18)</a> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;</span>
            
            <span id="2v19">(<a href="#2v19">19)</a> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first.</span>
            
            <span id="2v20">(<a href="#2v20">20)</a> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span>
            
            <span id="2v21">(<a href="#2v21">21)</a> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span>
            
            <span id="2v22">(<a href="#2v22">22)</a> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span>
            
            <span id="2v23">(<a href="#2v23">23)</a> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span>
            
            <span id="2v24">(<a href="#2v24">24)</a> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</span>
            
            <span id="2v25">(<a href="#2v25">25)</a> But that which ye have [already] hold fast till I come.</span>
            
            <span id="2v26">(<a href="#2v26">26)</a> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span>
            
            <span id="2v27">(<a href="#2v27">27)</a> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span>
            
            <span id="2v28">(<a href="#2v28">28)</a> And I will give him the morning star.</span>
            
            <span id="2v29">(<a href="#2v29">29)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="3v1">(<a href="#3v1">1)</a> And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</span>
            
            <span id="3v2">(<a href="#3v2">2)</a> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</span>
            
            <span id="3v3">(<a href="#3v3">3)</a> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</span>
            
            <span id="3v4">(<a href="#3v4">4)</a> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</span>
            
            <span id="3v5">(<a href="#3v5">5)</a> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</span>
            
            <span id="3v6">(<a href="#3v6">6)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span>
            
            <span id="3v7">(<a href="#3v7">7)</a> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</span>
            
            <span id="3v8">(<a href="#3v8">8)</a> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</span>
            
            <span id="3v9">(<a href="#3v9">9)</a> Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</span>
            
            <span id="3v10">(<a href="#3v10">10)</a> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v11">(<a href="#3v11">11)</a> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</span>
            
            <span id="3v12">(<a href="#3v12">12)</a> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, [which is] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and [I will write upon him] my new name.</span>
            
            <span id="3v13">(<a href="#3v13">13)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span>
            
            <span id="3v14">(<a href="#3v14">14)</a> And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</span>
            
            <span id="3v15">(<a href="#3v15">15)</a> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</span>
            
            <span id="3v16">(<a href="#3v16">16)</a> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="3v17">(<a href="#3v17">17)</a> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</span>
            
            <span id="3v18">(<a href="#3v18">18)</a> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and [that] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</span>
            
            <span id="3v19">(<a href="#3v19">19)</a> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</span>
            
            <span id="3v20">(<a href="#3v20">20)</a> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</span>
            
            <span id="3v21">(<a href="#3v21">21)</a> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</span>
            
            <span id="3v22">(<a href="#3v22">22)</a> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span>

            <span id="4v1">(<a href="#4v1">1)</a> After this I looked, and, behold, a door [was] opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</span>
            
            <span id="4v2">(<a href="#4v2">2)</a> And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and [one] sat on the throne.</span>
            
            <span id="4v3">(<a href="#4v3">3)</a> And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</span>
            
            <span id="4v4">(<a href="#4v4">4)</a> And round about the throne [were] four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</span>
            
            <span id="4v5">(<a href="#4v5">5)</a> And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span>
            
            <span id="4v6">(<a href="#4v6">6)</a> And before the throne [there was] a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, [were] four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</span>
            
            <span id="4v7">(<a href="#4v7">7)</a> And the first beast [was] like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast [was] like a flying eagle.</span>
            
            <span id="4v8">(<a href="#4v8">8)</a> And the four beasts had each of them six wings about [him]; and [they were] full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</span>
            
            <span id="4v9">(<a href="#4v9">9)</a> And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</span>
            
            <span id="4v10">(<a href="#4v10">10)</a> The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</span>
            
            <span id="4v11">(<a href="#4v11">11)</a> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="5v1">(<a href="#5v1">1)</a> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</span>
            
            <span id="5v2">(<a href="#5v2">2)</a> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</span>
            
            <span id="5v3">(<a href="#5v3">3)</a> And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</span>
            
            <span id="5v4">(<a href="#5v4">4)</a> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</span>
            
            <span id="5v5">(<a href="#5v5">5)</a> And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</span>

            <span id="5v7">(<a href="#5v7">7)</a> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</span>

            <span id="5v9">(<a href="#5v9">9)</a> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</span>

            <span id="11v1">(<a href="#11v1">1)</a> And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</span>
            
            <span id="11v2">(<a href="#11v2">2)</a> But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty [and] two months.</span>
            
            <span id="11v3">(<a href="#11v3">3)</a> And I will give [power] unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</span>
            
            <span id="11v4">(<a href="#11v4">4)</a> These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</span>

            <span id="11v6">(<a href="#11v6">6)</a> These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</span>
            
            <span id="11v7">(<a href="#11v7">7)</a> And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</span>
            
            <span id="11v8">(<a href="#11v8">8)</a> And their dead bodies [shall lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</span>
            
            <span id="11v9">(<a href="#11v9">9)</a> And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</span>
            
            <span id="11v10">(<a href="#11v10">10)</a> And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="11v11">(<a href="#11v11">11)</a> And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</span>
            
            <span id="11v12">(<a href="#11v12">12)</a> And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</span>
            
            <span id="11v13">(<a href="#11v13">13)</a> And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="11v14">(<a href="#11v14">14)</a> The second woe is past; [and], behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</span>
            
            <span id="11v15">(<a href="#11v15">15)</a> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</span>
            
            <span id="11v16">(<a href="#11v16">16)</a> And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</span>
            
            <span id="11v17">(<a href="#11v17">17)</a> Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</span>
            
            <span id="11v18">(<a href="#11v18">18)</a> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="11v19">(<a href="#11v19">19)</a> And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</span>

            <span id="12v1">(<a href="#12v1">1)</a> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</span>
            
            <span id="12v2">(<a href="#12v2">2)</a> And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</span>
            
            <span id="12v3">(<a href="#12v3">3)</a> And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</span>
            
            <span id="12v4">(<a href="#12v4">4)</a> And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</span>
            
            <span id="12v5">(<a href="#12v5">5)</a> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne.</span>
            
            <span id="12v6">(<a href="#12v6">6)</a> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days.</span>
            
            <span id="12v7">(<a href="#12v7">7)</a> And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</span>
            
            <span id="12v8">(<a href="#12v8">8)</a> And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="12v9">(<a href="#12v9">9)</a> And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</span>
            
            <span id="12v10">(<a href="#12v10">10)</a> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</span>
            
            <span id="12v11">(<a href="#12v11">11)</a> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</span>
            
            <span id="12v12">(<a href="#12v12">12)</a> Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</span>
            
            <span id="12v13">(<a href="#12v13">13)</a> And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man [child].</span>
            
            <span id="12v14">(<a href="#12v14">14)</a> And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</span>
            
            <span id="12v15">(<a href="#12v15">15)</a> And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</span>
            
            <span id="12v16">(<a href="#12v16">16)</a> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</span>
            
            <span id="12v17">(<a href="#12v17">17)</a> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span>

        <p>
            
            <span id="13v1">(<a href="#13v1">1)</a> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</span>
            
            <span id="13v2">(<a href="#13v2">2)</a> And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as [the feet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</span>
            
            <span id="13v3">(<a href="#13v3">3)</a> And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</span>
            
            <span id="13v4">(<a href="#13v4">4)</a> And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who [is] like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</span>
            
            <span id="13v5">(<a href="#13v5">5)</a> And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty [and] two months.</span>
            
            <span id="13v6">(<a href="#13v6">6)</a> And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</span>
            
            <span id="13v7">(<a href="#13v7">7)</a> And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</span>
            
            <span id="13v8">(<a href="#13v8">8)</a> And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span>

            <span id="13v11">(<a href="#13v11">11)</a> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</span>

            <span id="13v13">(<a href="#13v13">13)</a> And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</span>
            
            <span id="13v14">(<a href="#13v14">14)</a> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of] those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</span>
            
            <span id="13v15">(<a href="#13v15">15)</a> And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</span>
            
            <span id="13v16">(<a href="#13v16">16)</a> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</span>
            
            <span id="13v17">(<a href="#13v17">17)</a> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span>

            <span id="14v1">(<a href="#14v1">1)</a> And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</span>
            
            <span id="14v2">(<a href="#14v2">2)</a> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</span>
            
            <span id="14v3">(<a href="#14v3">3)</a> And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</span>
            
            <span id="14v4">(<a href="#14v4">4)</a> These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, [being] the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.</span>
            
            <span id="14v5">(<a href="#14v5">5)</a> And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</span>
            
            <span id="14v6">(<a href="#14v6">6)</a> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</span>
            
            <span id="14v7">(<a href="#14v7">7)</a> Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span>
            
            <span id="14v8">(<a href="#14v8">8)</a> And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</span>
            
            <span id="14v9">(<a href="#14v9">9)</a> And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</span>
            
            <span id="14v10">(<a href="#14v10">10)</a> The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</span>
            
            <span id="14v11">(<a href="#14v11">11)</a> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</span>
            
            <span id="14v12">(<a href="#14v12">12)</a> Here is the patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span>

            <span id="14v14">(<a href="#14v14">14)</a> And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud [one] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span>
            
            <span id="14v15">(<a href="#14v15">15)</a> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span>

            <span id="14v19">(<a href="#14v19">19)</a> And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</span>

            <span id="17v1">(<a href="#17v1">1)</a> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</span>
            
            <span id="17v2">(<a href="#17v2">2)</a> With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</span>
            
            <span id="17v3">(<a href="#17v3">3)</a> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span>
            
            <span id="17v4">(<a href="#17v4">4)</a> And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</span>
            
            <span id="17v5">(<a href="#17v5">5)</a> And upon her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</span>
            
            <span id="17v6">(<a href="#17v6">6)</a> And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</span>
            
            <span id="17v7">(<a href="#17v7">7)</a> And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</span>
            
            <span id="17v8">(<a href="#17v8">8)</a> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</span>
            
            <span id="17v9">(<a href="#17v9">9)</a> And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</span>

            <span id="17v15">(<a href="#17v15">15)</a> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</span>
